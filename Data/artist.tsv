963	On Dial Tones and Pretty Notes, his latest full- length album, Graham Nicholas has created an emotionally resonant world inhabited by troubled and love-hungry characters. Never alienated for their insecurities, his characters are instead respected by the empathetic voice of an honest songwriter. The album finds Nicholas honing in on his concise form of storytelling and refining his irreverent sense of humour. Coupling the narratives with a backing band that hearkens back to the likes of The Heartbreakers, The Travelling Wilburys, and The Byrds; Nicholas’ songs have found the right balance of warmth and grit. Not only has Graham Nicholas maintained an extensive and country crossing touring schedule, he has also shared the stage with the like of Ron Hynes Russell DeCarle, Catherine Maclellan, Old man Luedecke, Del Barber and Daniel Romano.\r\n\r\n 	["performingarts"]	[]	\N	\N	Graham Nicholas	4168888726	\N	t	\N	2019-02-01 18:30:03.03+00	2019-03-09 05:28:33.688+00	\N	\N	[]	[{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/grahamnicholasmusic/"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/graham_nicholas_music/"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"http://grahamnicholas.ca/"},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://grahamnicholas.bandcamp.com/track/sometimes-chicken-sometimes-feathers","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"3260116188"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://grahamnicholas.bandcamp.com/track/one-gallon-to-go","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"1934123723"}},{"mediaType":"embeddedYoutube","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hppyp-ExDl4&list=PL30ti-2eq3IgZLrSnq3t569oRnPwS8bIj"}]	I am a folk&roots/country musician. 	other-performingarts	["other-performingarts"]	\N	\N	Hppyp-ExDl4	\N	\N	\N

1242	The Promised started out as a roots/country duo consisting of Jesse and Noelle Burch. The pair met in 2018 while performing with their respective bands at the Cloverdale Rodeo. A mutual respect for music sparked a writing session, where it became clear their musical chemistry was undeniable. Blending genres and experimenting with their different influences created a synergy for writing catchy and original songs. \r\n\r\nSpending most of their time together writing for the next 4 months created an interesting dynamic, and in September of 2018, they were married, and their dreams of playing music together started to take shape. \r\n\r\nThe two teamed up with an incredible group of musicians from across western Canada and The Promised was born. They were accepted into the 2019 Breakthrough Country music project Top 12 with only one live show under their belt and after two rounds of competitions they were named 1st Place Grand Prize winners. \r\n\r\nWorking with Bailey Way Entertainment at the Warehouse Studios their debut single “We Could Be in Love” was released summer July 29th 2019. This summer will be a busy one for The Promised, highlights include playing the MainStage at Sunset prior to Jason Aldean. \r\n\r\nWith tight harmonies and a powerful sound, their music captures you within it's story.

1823	Satin Ragdoll & The Misfit toys is a pre-1920s through 1970s jazz cover band based in Los Angeles and led by vocalist Loren Marie Story. They bring modern instrumentation to classic songs while honoring their original mood and style. \r\n\r\nSelf-described as “born in the wrong decade,” Loren spent her childhood and early adult life with a deep love for show tunes and Hollywood Glamour of the 1930s and 40s. After performing with a swing dance “little big band” in the midwest for five years, Loren took her classical vocal training and stage experience and founded Satin Ragdoll in 2018. Satin Ragdoll now performs at private parties, corporate events, and public venues frequently all across Los Angeles and Orange counties, always dressing the part in vintage splendor. Her near and dear influences include Sarah Vaughan, Peggy Lee, Doris Day and Ella Fitzgerald. \r\n\r\nSatin Ragdoll is currently working on a release of originals, heavily inspired by the big band era as well as modern electro-swing artists such as Caro Emerald and Big Bad Voodoo Daddy.

53	Joe‘s philosophy: Play wherever they’ll listen. Whether it’s in a hot air balloon over the Swiss alps or at the Kerrville Folk festival in the hill country of Texas, or at the world fingerpicking championships in Winfield Kansas, Joe, on his faithful Martin D28, has played and people have come to listen.\nSimon’s philosophy: Play loud; play hard; play fair. Whether it’s in a blues band in the bars off St.Laurent in Montreal or in his crowded family living room or under a midnight sun at the North County fair, Simon, usually accompanied by a sunburst telecaster, has played loud, played hard, and played fair.\n\nThe two philosophies collided sometime around the turn-of-the-century in Halfmoon Bay, a narrow spit of land surrounded by ocean and rainforest in British Columbia’s not-always-so-sunny Sunshine Coast and has led to a musical collaboration that has created songs of love and loss and sleeping dogs, of idealhorses and broken down trucks. Songs that waltzed and rocked and two stepped; late night songs and early morning ones too.\nOccasionally arguing like brothers fighting over who gets the front seat, Simon and Joe, along with their band the Precious Littles, spent two years recording at Strait Sound studios. Simon co-produced Joe’s original tunes, along with producer and studio owner Ray Fulber, a creative union that, in 2008, culminated in Sometimes You Win, a cd BC Musician Magazine decreed to be“the perfect soundtrack for the dog days of summer”.\n\nFive days before the new CD was to be unveiled at the Islands Folk Festival something terrible happened. Simon fell.\nHe fell off an unsecured piece of scaffold and sustained life-threatening injuries to his brain and spinal cord. Joe and The Littles traveled to the festival and played the gig not knowing whether their friend and bandmate would survive the day.\nSimon survived. Instead of beginning the anticipated tour to promote a new cd he woke from a twenty-day comatose state and began the arduous work of recovery and rehabilitation. He had to learn how to live in a wheelchair. He had to re-learn how to swallow and how to move his left arm. He had to re-learn how to play guitar.\n\nJoe returned to the Sunshine Coast, week after week sitting in a room with Simon helping him re-learn the music they had once created together. These musical therapy sessions culminated in Simon playing with Joe and bassist Gerry Miller at Sechelt’s Olympic Torch Relay concert, a fitting gig to mark his first live performance since his accident, as the effort required to reach that point was truly Olympian.\n\nToday they have regrouped as a duo. Not only are they playing some of their older material and interpreting some of their most beloved songs but they are drawing on this latest life experience to create some exciting new work. New songs that are honest, challenging, and raw; new songs that are expressions of joy and love, of friendship and pain.\nMusic is a vital and elementalforce in their lives. It is music that has helped Joe and Simon find meaning and purpose in hard times; when they have fallen, it is music that has helped them get back up.\nAs a duo they aim to bring this love of music to communities across British Columbia and Canada. Through their live performances, group workshops or private lessons they promote the notion that music is medicine for body and soul and should be made accessible to everyone in a community.

572	Here North There is the musical start-up of Canadian singer/songwriter Chris Altrogge. Tying together influences from folk to indie, his songs are reflective of his musical journey so far. After a move from the Saskatchewan prairies to New York City in 2016, Chris formalized his songwriting under the moniker of Here North There; a name for a wandering Canadian making music south of the border, not being sure as to just where it would go. In the NY, Here North There found an audience on the platforms of the subway, and in small East Village venues; playing shows at the anti-folk famous SideWalk Cafe. Living up to the name, Here North There crossed the continent, making a pitstop in Saskatoon to record the 2017 single Take Me Anywhere, before heading to the west coast. In June of 2018, the collection Don’t Be Gone (And Other Songs) was quietly released online, the result of a songwriting experiment and foray into minimalist recording. Chris brings an element of surprise to each show with his multi-instrumental songs, featuring harmonicas, egg-shakers and tambourines all while strumming and singing away.

792	Canadian pop duo, Too Soon Monsoon, is building momentum toward their first full-length album release. The Saskatoon based duo released two EPs in the second half of 2017 (Little Fire - July 7, 2017 & Side Effects - Oct 20, 2017), performed at the Sasktel Saskatchewan Jazz Festival 2018, Ness Creek Music Festival 2017 & Winterruption 2018 and opened for PVRIS, Mo Kenney, Scenic Route to Alaska and ROMES. TSM embarked on their first Western Canadian tour in the fall of 2017, after opening for Wide Mouth Mason at a hometown show at O'Brians Event Centre. \r\n \r\nThe band is in the middle of recording their debut full-length album (slated for a spring 2019 release) once again with producer, Adam Grant. TSM previously worked closely with Grant on the recording of their first two EPs. Side Effects was included in the best EPs of 2017 by Cups n Cakes (#8) and spent four weeks in the CFCR Weekly Top Ten (peak #4).  Two new singles, "Ocean" and "Mountains of Blue" will be released in September and October while the band tours Western Canada prior to showcasing at BreakOut West in October 2018. \r\n \r\nToo Soon Monsoon’s debut full length record is a concept album that carries the listener on an emotional journey along with the band while speaking to universal themes like interconnectedness, growing up, love, seeking purpose and slowing down to appreciate and reconnect with yourself, one another, nature, art and spirit. Being a two-piece band that consists of an Indigenous drummer and a non-Indigenous singer/keyboardist, TSM’s goal is to create music and art that can bring people from different cultures and backgrounds closer together.\r\n\r\nTSM is known for their full live sound, often leaving audiences commenting on how surprised they are that it's just the two of them making so much noise and filling out the songs. Greg's wide vocal range and energetic presence behind the keyboard is a nice contrast to Nathan's stoic and powerful demeanor behind the drums. The duo is known to get audiences moving but is also capable of playing intimate venues that cater to storytelling and close listening.  The duo will be performing 'album-preview' experience shows in January, playing the brand new album front-back before it gets released in March!

852	Having found solace at a young age in Ella Fitzgerald and the vocal work of Louis Armstrong, JUNO nominated Alex Pangman also found a calling. Proud to be known as ‘Canada’s Sweetheart Of Swing’, her natural vocal abilities and obsessive, deep appreciation for that bygone era have earned her a place in our nation’s heart. She’s not old fashioned, though. Pangman is a vivacious performer who retains creative control of all her work: carefully choosing her repertoire, composing original material, assembling her backing band and co-producing much of her recent recorded output. Rather than some casual throwback, Pangman delivers a unique, deliberate reinterpretation of one of North America’s most fertile, timeless eras. Her newest record was JUNO nominated for jazz vocal and explores the popular songs of the 1920s, 30s, and 40s. Backed this year by a quintet of sentimental gentleman, Pangman’s performance is a sure bet to please all generations of jazz fans. Pangman has played both Massey Hall and Koerner Hall, and opened for Willie Nelson, Bob Newhart and played with both Bucky & John Pizzarelli, as well as being a music student to the late Jeff Healey.  Personnel: Alex Pangman (vocals), Chris Banks (bass), Glen Anderson (drums), Peter Hill (piano) John Macleod (cornet)	["music"]	[]	University student swing dance groups, professionals, dancers, retired peoples.	\N	Alex Pangman & Her Alleycats	416 8346173	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1540261078/artist/852/cover_photo.jpg	2018-10-23 02:15:51.96+00	2019-03-09 05:28:33.632+00	There is flexibility in the 2019 schedule.

740	Nova Scotiables are a high energy, Celtic Rock crew from all corners of Canada. Born in 2015 from late night whisky shots and chance busking encounters on the mean streets of Calgary, they've developed a reputation across southern Alberta for their original music and the contemporary hits they've been known to “Maritime-ize” when the mood strikes. With a wide reach of inspiration and plenty of Screech for perspiration these folks bring a party from the Right Coast that will have the whole family sippin’ and jiggin’ in no time.\r\n\r\nFearless leader Captain Hodgie steers the ship on lead vocals while bashing the bodhran and drums. AJ Baragar makes crowds swoon with sweet lead vocals and energetic guitar. Eric Minden’s enthusiastic bass playing gets him dancing madly into the middle of audiences. Heidi Pittman’s soulful fiddle and backing vocals invokes joy, sorrow and the East Coast spirit. Together this crew really brings the party!\r\n\r\nIn spring of 2020 the band digitally released their latest original tunes and some classic Maritime favourites on a fancy-shpancy new record “We’re Gonna Need A Bigger Boat”. It’s available now across all digital retailers and streaming services with physical copies for purchase on their online store (nova-scotiables.com/merch).\r\n\r\nPick up your pint...

964	On Dial Tones and Pretty Notes, his latest full- length album, Graham Nicholas has created an emotionally resonant world inhabited by troubled and love-hungry characters. Never alienated for their insecurities, his characters are instead respected by the empathetic voice of an honest songwriter.

1191	Whether performing with his band, The Red Dirt Posse, or as a solo or acoustic act, Cory will put on a high energy stage show that your audience will be sure to love. He is the current CCMA (Canadian Country Music Association) Spotlight Artist and completed an international tour in May 2019 with dates in British Columbia as well as Washington and Oregon state, including a sold-out show in Ashcroft, BC. He will be returning to the western US and Canada late August with a stop in Portland, Oregon as the opener for Whey Jennings, grandson of Waylon Jennings.\r\n\r\nCory's rich, soul-filled vocals helped gain him national exposure when he became the winner of the 2018 CCMA National Spotlight Performance Contest. Despite hailing from the smallest province in Canada, Prince Edward Island, Cory still received the largest number of fan votes to win the contest. This led to a performance at the Legends Show in Hamilton, Ontario for Canadian Country Music Week, sharing the stage with Chad Brownlee, Terri Clark, Aaron Goodvin, Charlie Major, Jason McCoy, JJ Shiplett, Patricia Conroy and Michelle Wright. \r\n\r\nCory was invited on stage to perform with legendary recording artist George Canyon when George toured Summerside, Prince Edward Island in November 2018. \r\n\r\nHis single “We Both Bleed” was released nationwide to Canadian radio stations on May 27, 2019. On May 28, 2019, the song was the number one most downloaded song by Canadian radio stations. On May 30, 2019, “We Both Bleed” remained in the top three most downloaded songs by radio stations in Canada.

256	The Fragments perform an eclectic range of indie pop, including diversions into jazz and folk music, with lyrical tangles that will keep you scratching your head while you tap your feet.\r\n\r\nTheir debut CD, which has been played by college radio stations across Canada, was praised by the Calgary Herald as being “an unabashedly odd and joyously weird, slightly askew pop record.”\r\n\r\nThe Fragments have headlined at a number of bars across Calgary, including The Ironwood, Broken City, Wine-Oh’s, The Ship & Anchor Pub, and The Hub at Mount Royal University. They were also pleased to be a featured performer at a So Far Sounds: Calgary event.\r\n\r\nThe fall of 2014 saw the release of their follow-up CD, which was reviewed by BeatRoute magazine: “most of the tracks on Stone Boat will creep their way into your daily humming routine at some point or another. These melodies beg to be hummed.”\r\n\r\nThe Fragments recorded their third album, Night Gardening, on a vintage reel-to-reel machine, called the Stephens 821B. It was a record packed with delicious pop weirdness, tied together with the rich, warm sound of analog tape.\r\n\r\nTheir latest CD, Erratics (released in April, 2017), finds intriguing and strange inspiration from the field of geology. Songs about mountain formations, early geologists, and glacial erratics give the album a focussed feel. But things are never quite what they seem with The Fragments: mountains complain about the horror of erosion, a geologist disco-dances with a shark, and the erratic might just be waking up from a blackout after a night of hard drinking.

1519	During a distinguished career spanning over four decades,  McCandless brings a soaring lyricism to his playing and composing that has been integral to the ensemble sound of two seminal iconic bands of jazz: the original Paul Winter Consort and the relentlessly innovative quartet, OREGON.\r\n\r\nA gifted multi-instrumentalist and composer, he specializes in the oboe, English horn, bass clarinet, soprano and sopranino saxophones and a collection of folk flutes reflecting his grounding in both classical and jazz disciplines.   Trained at the Manhattan School of Music, he was a finalist in the 1971 English horn auditions for the New York Philharmonic.  As a collaborator and solo artist, he has performed on more than 200 albums and appeared with such musicians as Pat Metheny, Jaco Pastorius,  Wynton Marsalis, Lyle Mays, Mark Isham, Boz Scaggs, Steve Reich, Al Jarreau, Bruce Hornsby, Art Lande, Carla Bley, Michael McDonald, Tony Furtado, the String Cheese Incident, Nguyen Le, Proteus 7, Fred Simon, and many more.\r\n\r\nIn 1996, he won a Grammy for Best Pop Instrumental with Béla Fleck and the Flecktones.  McCandless’ fine-tuned compositional skills have been featured in a number of film scores. Most notably, he wrote music for the video Squanto and the First Thanksgiving, a Rabbit Ears Production, with Graham Greene as narrator.  Paul recorded three of his orchestral scores for a CD called “Oregon In Moscow”, featuring OREGON and the Moscow Tchaikovsky Orchestra.\r\n\r\n“Round Robin,” the opening track, received two 2001 Grammy nominations for Best Instrumental Composition and Best Instrumental Arrangement.  As an orchestral soloist, he has performed with the Camerata Chamber Orchestra of Mexico City, the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra, and the Philadelphia, Buffalo, Los Angeles, and Stuttgart Symphony Orchestras.\r\n\r\nMcCandless was a featured soloist alongside Pat Metheny and Gary Burton at “The Great Jubilee Concert”, a huge tribute event in Theaterhaus Stuttgart in 2015, by the SWR Big Band celebrating the music and the career of the legendary German bassist Eberhard Weber.  The event was encapsulated on the CD “Hommage a Eberhard Weber” (2015, ECM Records). McCandless appears on two of Weber’s CDs as a leader. The London Telegraph called McCandless' contributions to the concert "remarkable". Said Jazz Journal, "Paul McCandless delivered terrific, beautifully modulated solos on both oboe and soprano."\r\n \r\nMcCandless has been called "one of only a handful of master oboists playing jazz" by the Marin Independent Journal.  And of one of McCandless' own group's concerts, the Washington Post said: "the group deftly explored more imaginatively orchestrated pieces, balancing contemplative and colorfully textured works that made use of a broad variety of mostly reed instruments (and an electronic wind synthesizer) with more rhythmically aggressive pieces that were often marked by spirited and sometimes rhapsodic improvisations by McCandless". The South China Morning Post said he is "a particular pleasure to hear." Said the Birmingham Post, "McCandless soars". And the Washington Post described McCandless as a "stellar player" and as offering "sparkling harmonic cascades." The Jerusalem Post said when McCandless performs, he "sprinkles feather-light soprano saxophone touches."\r\n	["music"]	[]	\N	\N	Jon Krosnick	6145797983	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1585148166/artist/1519/cover_photo.jpg	2020-03-25 14:55:36.759+00	2020-03-25 14:56:26.676+00	\N	\N	[{"index":0,"publicId":"artist/1519/hi-res/0.png","version":1585148185}]	[{"mediaType":"website","url":"http://www.chargedparticles.com/with-saxophonist-paul-mccandless.html"},{"mediaType":"youtubeChannel","url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVzlCb0qQ1aCg-XBPsqAMqw"},{"mediaType":"embeddedYoutube","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhM20EUjKw0"}]	Grammy Award winner and world renowned jazz superstar Paul McCandless is now touring and performing his original compositions with the celebrated Bay-Area jazz trio Charged Particles.	jazz	["other-music"]	covers	\N	hhM20EUjKw0	\N	\N	\N

1255	Think Amy Winehouse backed by the Blackhearts, Wanda Jackson fronting Hole; and you’ve still only scratched the surface of what this melodic trio can accomplish. Among the raw energy of their punk rock sensibilities lies a deeper carnal instinct, one matched with a notable understanding of composition, harmonies and delivery. \r\n\r\nFronted by powerhouse vocalist and music history aficionado Deicha Carter, the Torchettes inception was one she had been constructing for years before they hit the stage. Inspired by the swagger of The Supremes and post-grunge, blues and R&B;  Carter harnessed the power of three (Chenelle Roberts, Sydney Zadravec) and they have constructed a group and sound unlike any other. \r\n\r\nThe result is an ethereal and mysterious presence that can seem altogether taboo, like sneaking cigarettes from a relative. Songs like Mean Charlene completely buck the songwriting trends of their early soul influences, a genre usually marked by its brave missive, yet repressed sexuality. Lines like “I follow her on my bike, she’s a rock n’ roll dyke, I wanna feel her rage in between my legs” demonstrate their absolute disregard for any suppression or subjection whatsoever. \r\n\r\nForward in lyrical approach, bewitching in their delivery; a performance from the Torchettes can feel like a gathering of the occult. Mystical and hypnotic, and altogether understated in its power, they’ve been quick to rise among the Calgary music scene as a trio unlike any other. Amid the rumbling of their contagious energy and dynamic, The Torchettes have found an undeniably magical formula of mayhem and melodic poise - one sure to captivate and transfix audiences for years to come.

One of Maddison’s most memorable and impactful experiences was her contribution to the Make A Wish Foundation when she was able to help a Make A Wish Child fulfil their dream of writing and recording their own song. Maddison co-wrote the song, and the two went to a Nashville recording studio to record it. They performed their song alongside one another for an audience of family and supports at the live-music venue Analog in Nashville, TN. \r\n\r\n“I’ve never felt so fulfilled. Music really shows its power in those moments.” Maddison Krebs \r\n\r\nFrom being a 6 year old girl putting her poetry to music - to a valuable member of the Young Canadians - to a frequent on the top of the iTunes charts.

743	El Cosgrove is a red-headed, boot-wearing, country singer-songwriter who has drawn greatly upon her upbringing in rural Australia and other life experiences to write unique and authentic music which she delivers with ‘a voice unlike any other in Australian country music’ (Jolene: The Country Music Blog). Having released her debut EP ‘Guitars & Cigars’ in January 2017, winning over the hearts of country music loving masses at the ‘Tamworth Country Music Festival’ and being met with rave reviews, AMNplify declares that ‘El Cosgrove’s star is on the rise’ and that ‘it’s clear Cosgrove is going places’.\r\n\r\nProduced by ARIA/Golden Guitar winning producer Matt Fell, along with the work of various highly respected industry musicians such as Glen Hannah, Josh Schuberth and Luke Moller, combined with El’s all-original material and unique sound, ‘Guitars & Cigars’ is ‘solid in both a musical and production sense’ (AMNplify) and is a true ‘declaration of Cosgrove as an artist’ (Jolene: The Country Music Blog).\r\n‘Upon first listen, Cosgrove’s silvery rasp immediately captures her audiences attention. There’s a delicacy to the Australian’s delivery, yet her voice contains enough grit to lend weight to her words’(goodnighthestia.com).\r\n\r\nLeading up to the recording of her debut EP, El had already been surrounded by music since a very early age and after graduating school she travelled to Canada where she was immersed in the rodeo and ranch life of Alberta as well as having the opportunity to perform at the ‘Ladies of Canadian Pro Rodeo Luncheon and Fashion Show’ as part of the ‘Canadian Finals Rodeo’ in Edmonton. Upon returning to Australia she graduated from the CMAA Academy of Country Music in Tamworth and went on to continue playing regular concerts and festivals including The Gympie Muster, The Village Festival, Tamworth Country Music Festival, Light the Night Yeppoon, St. Brendan’s College Rodeo and Australia Day Celebrations Dalby, just to name a few.\r\nAdditionally, El has been privileged to have co-written songs with both Kasey Chambers and Ashleigh Dallas, share the stage with the likes of Catherine Britt, Karl Broadie, Lyn Bowtell, Kevin Bennett, Dobe Newton and Roger Corbett (The Bushwackers) and fellow academy students as well as having the opportunity to work with Amber Lawrence and Aleyce Simmonds. She has also performed as a support artist for Liam Brew and Seleen Mcalister at the Rainforest Ranch near Byfield, as well as seven-time Golden Guitar winner Luke O’Shea at Katherine Outback Experience in the Northern Territory.\r\n\r\n‘Cosgrove has already achieved a lot but there is no doubt more ahead’ (Jolene: The Country Music Blog). She looks forward to continuing to split her time between life on the land, songwriting and touring, bringing her music and original performances to a range of crowds.

759	Future Womb is the brainchild of multidisciplinary Calgary artist, Mikaela Cochrane. With collaborators Jordan Moe (guitar) and Michael De Souza (bass) of local folkadelic quintet The Ashley Hundred, and Andrew Ellergodt of Andrew’s Pale Horses, bringing the groove, this new project's eclectic sound will keep you guessing. Despite only forming in Summer 2017, Future Womb has performed at a number of Alberta festivals, as well as in live sessions on both CKUA radio's The Spot and CJSW radio's Suffragette City. Their debut full-length album, BABYGIRLGALACTIC is currently in the works with Mikaela's brother and mentor, Taylor Cochrane (Musician behind 36?, Jason Famous & Le Fame, Fuck Boy), as producer.\r\n\r\nBABYGIRLGALACTIC is an eleven track autobiographical concept album exploring the sexual and relationship trauma that Mikaela experienced over the four years that this album documents. The name comes from the feeling she had of fitting into a role of an obedient and palatable woman, while also recognizing the infinite potential inside herself to be so much more; the frustration, humiliation, and illusion of power in the choice to stay small.\r\n\r\n"Captivating audiences with her pure voice, dark lyrics, eccentric costumes and makeup, and dramatic stage presence, Future Womb quashes the belief that music is just an auditory experience -- which is largely a result of Cochrane's background in acting, musical theatre, and burlesque."

766	Hailing from the heart of the new west, Calgary, AB, the emerging garage influenced four-piece utilizes and draws inspiration from all that the rock genre has to offer. Fronted by brothers Dylan (Lead vocals, Guitar) and Steven Evanik (Lead guitar, vocals) there is a certain allure to the sibling’s enthralling live demeanour. Encompassing a youthful and unabashed confidence, their most recent release High Plains has been described by Mike Bell (theYYSCENE) as “a gnarly, almost belligerently cool slab of stoner rock, muscled-up pop-punk and ’90s mostly metal...” with Dylan’s vocals concisely characterized as a “guttural, man sized howl.”\r\n\r\nWith a dedicated fan-base at home, it is their tumultuous and inclusive live show that is hard to deny, having provided the group with such opportunities as supporting Danko Jones, Grandson, Metz and The Dudes. Currently in studio working on a new material, the group will have a fresh set of new tracks for early 2019 including a single release set for April 12th. It is unclear when the next full length will come to light but in the meantime we can expect to see Crooked Spies throughout western Canada this spring with a planned appearance at this year’s Canadian Music Week.

558	My name is Jess; I’m a Calgary born and raised acoustic pop singer-songwriter! My sets are performed solo with vocals and an acoustic guitar to create a laid back and intimate atmosphere.  I prefer to focus on original music that engages an audience but also realize cover songs can unite people through shared moments and memories. The universal connection music ignites within and between people is what drives me to write and perform. My passion for performance and songwriting started early on when my parents gave me my first Britney Spears CD.  From the moment I heard the opening piano riff of “Hit me Baby One More Time” I was hooked, and knew when I grew up I wanted to be a part of the music community. I can’t wait to connect with the YYC music tribe!

Though the gallery itself is no longer open, its essence lives on as the local community record label United Bakery Records, which released "The Tumbling Wheels Play The No Counts," recognized by Offbeat Magazine as one of the 50 best albums of 2016 and nominated for one of their Best of the Beat awards the same year. They play regularly in New Orleans and recently played at the 2018 Jazz and Heritage Festival.\r\n \r\nThe band is comprised of Jeffrey Sutton (vocals/guitar/violin), Rachel Wolf (vocals), Joanna Tomassoni (drums/vocals/guitar), James Stram (bass), and Sam Ottinger (guitar).

442	Alberta musician Sam Lundell has grown up performing since age 5. Beginning in the classical music scene, and slowly absorbing inspiration from numerous genres and styles, Sam has recently released his debut album HEAD / / HANDS.\r\n\r\nLundell’s first single, Everything, was awarded a Telus Optik TV Storyhive grant; the subsequent Music Video (directed by Justin Brunelle) won top prize in that competition, and was later nominated for a Rosie award. \r\n\r\nFollowing the success of “Everything”, Sam was granted the resources to begin work on his first full length project at the Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity. The result is Sam’s 9 track, 45 minute, debut album.\r\n\r\nThe record is a diverse and dynamic look at story telling, both fact and fiction, set before a backdrop of indie rock and electronic sounds. Inspired by such varied artists as Switchfoot, John Mayer, RadioHead, and Maroon 5, Sam is thrilled to be able to share this journey with everyone and anyone who is looking to ask the urgent questions, and celebrate in simple joys.

The Métis singer was described by CBC Reclaimed host Jarrett Martineau as “One of my favourite new artists from the West Coast underground... Caitlin Goulet writes songs that are like dreams you can get lost in.” \r\n\r\nHer album “Inside Thoughts” explores the inner world of a sad-girl gone bad-girl who’s bossing up and healing. Raw, conversational, and unapologetic lyrics are channeled through a dynamic and magnetic voice.

His unique perspective and refreshing lyrics break the barrier between audience and performer, while his simplistic storytelling makes even the quirkiest of situations relatable. From heartfelt songs sung about his love and appreciation for his grandma, to the wacky fictional story about a boy who “Saves the Whales.” Now at the age of 24, he is making his mark in the flourishing Edmonton music scene having performed solo at the Edmonton and Canmore Folk Music Festivals. Some say that even in the darkest, dustiest room, Travis’ performances make you feel like you’re water-skiing on a lake on top of a mountain with a view only the birds share.

107	Samm has grown a music career from roots that stretch from sea to sky. Growing up between the celtic vibes of Halifax and the cowboy culture of Alberta, he has been exposed to a soundscape that spans seven provinces. After bouncing back and forth between these two settings as a child, Samm has made a home among the rocky mountains in Canmore, Alberta.\nSamm has taken his career to the next step with a solo EP. The four-song EP was released on July 1st, 2016, was recorded in Canmore at Big Horn Studios and was produced by Geoff Hilhorst of The Deep Dark Woods. \nSamm’s music touches on a range of genres including rock, funk and pop. His self-titled EP reflects this range as the raw rock ’n’ roll feel of ‘Hipsters’ and ‘Mountain Song’ serve as energetic bookends to the softer pop vibes of ‘Hold on Feelin’’ and ‘Thinking Of You.’ Samm lists The Tragically Hip, Hey Rosetta and Tom Waits as some of his biggest influences.

804	Heavydive is a three-piece rock band that mixes post-punk rhythms and shoegaze soundscapes with dreary, yet angelic, vocals reminiscent of Ian Curtis, Morrissey, and Robert Smith. Inspired by the turmoils of mental illness, escaping emotional abuse, and the fear of failure, their work soars and crashes with sonic intensity that brims with melancholy, uncertainty and hope.\r\n\r\nWith a growing musical prescence, much has been said about Heavydive's sound:\r\n\r\n"Their music is a loud, sonic catharsis that inspires gazes aimed at the heavens more than at a ratty pair of Converse." - Sled Island 2018\r\n\r\n"Equal parts moody and euphoric, the band manages to sonically capture a snapshot of the world around them that feels authentic and powerful. To get a sense of how emotionally compelling the group can sound, just listen to “Room 213” as the song hits the 01:47 mark. Chills. That was the exact moment we knew Heavydive was special." - When The Sun Hits Blog\r\n\r\nWith the release of their EP, Warn the Dark, Heavydive has begun establishing themselves within the Canadian music scene. With their stage debut in the winter of 2017, Heavydive has now performed alongside several Canadian heavy hitters such as Napalpom, Wares, Counterfeit Jeans, Bad Animal,  Tiny Shrine, and Palm Haze, while also opening for the San Diego based band Earthless.

90	Corinne was born and raised in Hamilton Ontario and is a musician/singer/songwriter who spans a multitude of genres having grown up with the likes of R&B, jazz, and rock influences. Her voice is recognizable in these styles as an artful array of easy listening and intense presence; if you've heard her, you know what she can do.\n Her career spans a quadruple decade of commitment, having worked with some of the best including Dwight Yoakam, Dick Clark (American Bandstand...yes she did the show!), The Beach Boys, Dan Hill, Arsenio Hall and Daniel Lanois (U2/Bob Dylan/Emmy Lou Harris et al).  Touring and live were her commanders so to speak, and she continues to share her experiences, both as a working musician/vocalist and voice/jazz theory instructor, currently serving on faculty at Mount Royal University, The Conservatory, in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, where she is entering her 10th year as an instructor.    \n\nAlthough she resides in Alberta, she still considers Hamilton her home, giving honourable mention each and every time she has the chance. \n​\n    Her days at the infamous Grant Avenue Studios with famed and world renowned Grammy-award winning producer, Daniel Lanois, (Peter Gabriel/Emmy Lou Harris et al) helped  cement the place and time where she learned her craft and honed her skills as a performer and session singer.\nShe has a ton of credits to her name and is an incredible live performer. A love of music is ever present and her style displays a sense of undeniable seasoning.\nYou simply won't be disappointed when you hear this artist.\n​\n  Music, she says, 'is a conduit to the insatiable desire for perfection in creativity and the incomparability of composure, if you can attain it. To sing and perform is tantamount to a lottery win, when the surroundings are ideal'.

Formed in early 2014 and releasing their debut album the following spring, 2016 marks their 3rd year as a band.\n\nRich with thoughtful texture and stirring rhythms, RDR’s music has always had duality at its core; blending the subtle and the complex, the calculated and the wild, the light and the dark.

Their live performances are sincere, impassioned and captivating, and together the pair have an undeniable on-stage chemistry.\n\nThey are incredibly proud of their hometown, Calgary, and all it has to offer musically.

565	In 2009, Steve Lane set about committing a bunch of his songs to tape, enlisting good mates Darren Seltmann (Ripe, The Avalanches), Jimmy Williams (The Shedshakers, Paul Kelly and the Dots) and Pete Slater (Dalriada) to add their considerable talents to the project.\r\n“Working as a community musician, songwriter and sound engineer, I’ve always thought it important to get the balance right… If I’m telling my own stories through music, I’m far more effective helping others tell theirs”  \r\nWith the addition of Augie March’s revered rhythm section (David Williams and Edmondo Ammendola) Steve Lane and The Autocrats were born and a debut album recorded at Melbourne’s Newmarket Studios under the careful direction of producer/engineer, Ben Hurt.\r\nIn 2011, ‘The Romance of Communication’ was released through ABC Music/Universal and was listed for the Australian Music Prize, as well as scoring the coveted album of the week on ABC JJ/DIG MUSIC\r\n“Steve Lane & The Autocrats release and album that has all the tell-tale signs of an Australian band bound for longevity” - Isabella Tolhurst (FasterLouder)\r\n“Honestly, the album is a genuine all-killer affair” - Tony McMahon (Inpress)\r\n “If more pop-rock was this unfussy yet smart (not to mention well-read and funny), we would all have easier lives. … There are moments of '70s rock, twangin' instrumentals and open-hearted ballads that sit somewhere between the Go-Betweens and Tim Freedman. “- Bernard Zuel (Sydney Morning Herald)\r\nFirst single ‘Ghost Trains’ impressed.\r\n“It’s a pretty special thing to find new music that takes you back, but I’ve found it in Steve Lane and The Autocrats’ new single ‘Ghost Trains.’ It’s got that lovely Paul Kelly storytelling quality about it, with a splash of Weddings Parties Anything thrown in. Its good honest Aussie pub rock, melodic but heartfelt. Can you believe that something that sounds so seasoned comes from a debut?”\r\n-Lauren Katulka. (Sounds Of Oz.)\r\n\r\nSteve Lane and The Autocrats were also featured on The Wiggles tribute album ‘Rewiggled’ alongside the likes of Sarah Blasko, The Living End and Spiderbait.\r\nSteve Lane and The Autocrats’  sophomore album ‘Birds Taking Flight’ was released in 2013 and the lead single ‘Thirteen’ shone brightly, receiving overwhelming praise from media and punters alike reaching the finals of the International Songwriting Competition in 2014 and 2015.\r\nRolling Stone’s Darren Levin wrote that “Birds Taking Flight is a bunch of mates writing tightly honed songs with their blinkers on… Lane’s heart is in the right place when he pays tribute to Pakistani activist Malala Youssafzai on ‘Thirteen’’.’\r\n‘Birds Taking Flight’ again featured the sublime playing of Jim Williams, Ammendola and David Williams and introduced Steve’s son Kai, who eventually replaced Ammendola on bass.\r\n2015 saw Steve showcase at Canadian Music Week in Toronto and make the kind of connections that will see his career traverse both Australia and Canada in the future.\r\nMoving on from The Autocrats in 2017, Steve Lane’s third album ‘The Revenge of the Lawn’ is a culmination of some great and some “shit” life experiences shared with band mates and long-time collaborators. The last few years have challenged Steve to the core with the loss of both his parents.  This loss has informed the heart of the songs on The Revenge of the Lawn but has not left them without hope.  \r\nThere’s a vulnerability and an intimacy heard on record that is undeniable" - The AU Review\r\n\r\n"The start of a new and exciting chapter in the life of one of Australia’s most loved songwriters" - Rhythms\r\n\r\n"Revenge Of The Lawn is going to be one of those albums that all Australian Music fans really connect with, Steve's managed to take his head out of the equation and just use his heart" -  Graham Ashton Footstomp Music\r\nSteve’s songs come from the great Australian tradition of lyricists like Paul Kelly and Courtney Barnett.  These songs have been co-written with acclaimed Australian poet John Holton and recorded with David Williams on drums, Jacob McGuffie and Steve on guitars and Kai Lane-Uren playing bass. The album was lusciously mixed by underrated Rangemaster engineer David Carr, recently lauded for his work on Russell Morris’s award winning album ‘Sharkmouth’.\r\n"Steve Lane’s songs aren’t ripped from the headlines, they’re torn out of your diaries, overhead from your friend’s stories and about as real and Australian as dual citizenship and marrying who you love" - Bernard Zuel \r\n“The connective tissue of love embraces the planet as it draws us into ourselves in 'Dot Point', while the mood is leavened with a jaunty look at the world from the perspective of Russia's first cosmonaut in 'Motherland', another view if you like to the 'core' of the world to which we are all drawn, the 'inner' space of the final track 'Cocoon; all 'angry' chorus guitars counterpointing sparsely-backed musings on the inevitability of loss, fading out into unsettling ambience. There's slow groove Tex Mex Mystery in the mix for 'Monsoon Heartbreak, contrasting the easy lope of opening cut 'Camber', two views of love's possibilities” -  Michael Smith (Rhythms)\r\nCamber was semi-finalist in the International Song Writing Contest 2016 and 2017.\r\n	["music"]	[]	\N	\N	Steve Lane		\N	t	\N	2018-06-16 15:06:51.774+00	2019-03-09 05:28:33.507+00	\N	\N	[]	[{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/stevelaneofficial/"},{"mediaType":"twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/AutocratsLane"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"http://www.stevelane.com.au"},{"mediaType":"youtubeChannel","url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChyvYevPRh9sSMt3qtPjgDw"}]	Award winning song-smith, Steve Lane is touring Canada this summer with his latest album ‘The Revenge Of The Lawn’, his multi-instrumentalist son Kai, and their sun-drenched Australian Americana.	americana	["alt-country"]	originals	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

1841	Drummer/Percussionist/Vocalist Elizabeth Goodfellow (Iron and Wine, Allison Russell, boygenius, Madison Cunningham) lives in Los Angeles, CA. Her solo project centers around singer-songwriter material performed on the marimba. 	["music"]	[]	Beth Goodfellow’s singer-songwriter approach to the marimba was born out of a desire to write songs on a chordal instrument after drumming in other people’s bands. She bought a 1920s Deagan Marimba through Craigslist and began incorporating it into her original songs. When the pandemic hit in 2020 she spent the better part of eighteen months writing for voice and marimba from Tucson, AZ and her apartment in Los Angeles. The pandemic allowed her time to strip the marimba and vocal approach down to the basics and focus on writing two-minute songs that were intended to be stream-of-conscious with minimal rewrites. These songs were released in early 2021 as the band camp album “Hunting The Silence”. Beth’s writing for marimba also draws inspiration from the polyrhythmic counterpoint of minimalist composer Steve Reich. By building loops of marimba counterpoint she creates a uniquely meditative backdrop for her lyrics and vocals.	\N	Elizabeth Goodfellow	4156993786	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1650039467/artist/1841/cover_photo.jpg	2021-04-10 22:51:15.896+00	2022-04-15 16:23:14.587+00	\N	[{"name":"Club Congress, Tucson, AZ","date":"2022/03"},{"name":"Tucson Folk Festival","date":"2022/03"}]	[{"index":0,"publicId":"artist/1841/hi-res/0.jpg","version":1650039516},{"index":1,"publicId":"artist/1841/hi-res/1.jpg","version":1650039500},{"index":2,"publicId":"artist/1841/hi-res/2.jpg","version":1650039488}]	[{"mediaType":"embeddedYoutube","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSndFG4MLoI"},{"mediaType":"youtubeChannel","url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAQoK_A9Nd7TPBqpyj8qWqA"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/beth_goodfellow/"},{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/elizabethgoodfellowmusic"},{"mediaType":"twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/Beth_Goodfellow"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"https://www.elizabethgoodfellow.com"},{"mediaType":"spotify","url":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/2UgLSq4EbZEew5OVQg5756?si=cU_Ye47BQwmjBAGZO1Nmeg"},{"mediaType":"appleMusic","url":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/elizabeth-goodfellow/1292149783"},{"mediaType":"soundCloud","url":"https://soundcloud.com/elizabethgoodfellow"},{"mediaType":"bandcampArtist","url":"https://elizabethgoodfellow.bandcamp.com"},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://elizabethgoodfellow.bandcamp.com/album/milwaukee","metadata":{"type":"album","id":"1969743448"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://elizabethgoodfellow.bandcamp.com/album/terror-and-trust","metadata":{"type":"album","id":"2398103003"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://elizabethgoodfellow.bandcamp.com/album/hunting-the-silence","metadata":{"type":"album","id":"3647117113"}}]	Drummer/Percussionist/Vocalist Elizabeth Goodfellow (Iron and Wine, Allison Russell, boygenius, Madison Cunningham) lives in Los Angeles, CA. 	singer-songwriter	["alternative"]	originals	\N	bSndFG4MLoI	\N	\N	\N

1067	Last June we performed at Cafe Koi; however, I had two performance times as the venue was too small to accommodate everyone. This year I am looking to try somewhere new and give my clients a different experience. The students cover the genres of classical, musical theatre, top 40, pop, jazz, and country. I'm looking for a venue that will accommodate about 50-60 people. The reasons I avoid typical recital themes is to make this a fun evening for the entire family. I want the parents to be able to enjoy an adult beverage with delicious food while they watch their child perform in a comfortable environment. Yes these kids are students and are learning, however, all performances are well rehearsed. My students range from 6 years-old to adult. The evening will likely last 90 minutes with a short break featuring a spoken word artist after 45 minutes to add some diversity to the event.

1616	Being the youngest in the family of musicians allowed him to sit in the student seat quite often, learning and obtaining a passion for the art of music, while no one else really noticed he was absorbing the lessons. He studied music as a vocalist and saxophonist, but later picked up drums, and piano.\r\n\r\nTerrell left his home state at age 18 to join the U.S. Navy, and returned as a songwriter, while continuing to build an impressive resume as a businessman and motivational speaker. He later got a songwriting break when his aunt who owned a radio station introduced him to multi-platinum producer, Allan “Grip” Smith.\r\n\r\nTerrell moved to Atlanta working with Smith on a wide array of artist projects including, Keith Sweat, LSG, Old Skool, Jagged Edge, Dru Hill and Excape. Terrell continued writing songs for other R&B, Pop, and Gospel artist, but it was there that he found a larger audience for singing and the live stage. ​\r\n\r\nActing on a desire to return to his musical roots, Terrell Edwards and Reach released their first Album, “More than Conquerors” in 2006. He later moved to Edmonton, Alberta, releasing his second album “The Living Room” with Tate Music Group in 2012. The album was well received in North America, with singles “To Worship you”, and “Not Ashamed” reaching Billboards top 200.\r\n\r\nTerrell started the following decade with another change of course. In 2012 he began writing and producing music videos and live productions, and produced the radio show, “Inspire Time” in 2014.\r\n\r\nHe once again broadened his artistic repertoire, as he took the stage as an adult contemporary artist. His artistic journey continues, writing and producing for other artist, in various genres, while continuing as a solo artist himself.\r\n\r\nTerrell moved to Atlanta working with Smith on a wide array of artist projects including, Keith Sweat, LSG, Old Skool, Jagged Edge, Dru Hill and Excape. Terrell continued writing songs for other R&B, Pop, and Gospel artist, but it was there that he found a larger audience for singing and the live stage. ​\r\n\r\nTerrell founded and performs with the Tri-City Rat pack, giving tribute to the late great Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, and Sammy Davis Jr. Terrell’s latest album “Unchained” was released in September 2018.\r\nSome of his greatest influences in music has been legends like Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, Luther Vandross, and Kenny “Baby Face” Edmonds, to name a few.\r\n\r\n “I hope to inspire people in everything I’m blessed to be a part of.

1158	Miranda's live performance fuses the emotion of music with the power of poetry, using the rhythmic and melodic components of song to elevate her words and engage the audience. She challenges the public to participate in the creation of small bits of voice and self-expression, encouraging them in co-creating an experience involving both performer and audience. Her themes are always positive and uplifting, often humorous, focusing on empowerment and self-discovery. Some of her most common pieces include "Crazy," "Imperfect," "Pasta Poem," and her signature piece, "If You Got a Sound."

104	This folk-roots duo first took the stage together New Year's Eve of 2009, married in 2010 and formed Zonnis in 2013, a celebration of the birth of their son Zander. With a full commitment to love in every mold imaginable, they regularly tour Western Canada, sometimes dipping into the coastal United States and taking touring, writing and family trips throughout Central America. Anywhere an audience is open-minded and engaged is Zonnis' favourite place to perform. Some festivals they have enjoyed rocking include Artswells, Arts on the Fly, MoM, Soul Fest and Hootstock. With enough originals to fill an evening and enough beloved cover tunes to fill a lifetime, a Zonnis show is about engaging and entertaining an audience through a musical adventure.

121	Ten albums into an already acclaimed career, Stephen Simmons sharpens his rootsy folk-rock with A World Without, a record that mixes the twang of country music — a genre that provided the soundtrack for his childhood in small-town Tennessee — with the sharp observations of a singer/songwriter and the stomp of rural, roadhouse rock & roll.\n\nA road warrior with an audience on both sides of the Atlantic, Simmons has spent most of his adulthood on stage, playing songs in ten different countries along the way. Recorded with members of his touring band, A World Without explores a life lived on the run, taking a look at the intersection between art, commerce, love, and travel. The songs are equal parts biography and fiction, with Simmons shining a light on those who travel and create for a living. There are tracks about Americans crossing the country during the Gold Rush, about puritans making a voyage overseas, about lovers becoming parents, and about Simmons himself.\n\nA World Without also features harmony vocals from his father, uncle, and sister, a move that allows Simmons to pay tribute to the family members who’ve inspired his career. It’s an album that hits close to home in more ways than one. Contributions from his longtime band members — including keyboardist Molly Jewell, guitarist Dave Coleman, pedal steel guitarist Alex McCullough, drummer Tim Blankenship, bassist Duane Blevins and producer/utility player Eric Fritsch — provide the backdrop for Simmons’ voice, an alt-country croon inspired by everyone from Don Williams to Bruce Springsteen.

134	Calgary’s Bebo Grove is a four-piece band formed in 2015 by long-time friends and collaborating musicians and songwriters, Jason Selby and Jeff Ragan.  With the addition of Jordan Clermont, a local singer-songwriter, on vocals, and Anthony Heywood-Smith, a multi-instrumentalist, Australian Singer-Songwriter, on drums, the four created a sound that combines a unique blend of styles to create a melodic, emotive sound.  Their music is heavily influenced by a variety of songwriters, bands, and genres, combining poetic lyrics with an energetic fusion of folk, world music, and alternative rock.  Bebo Grove released their debut EP, Vacant Places, in March 2016 and, in September 2016, the band was awarded the first ever Zackariah and The Prophets Memorial Award for best upcoming artist in Calgary at the inaugural YYC Music Awards.

150	The first thing that strikes listeners about Hamilton’s (ON) Gillian Nicola is the strength of her vocals. Nicola’s vocal delivery is full of power, while remaining authentic and vulnerable. The singer/songwriter calls on influences of folk, rock and alt-country to create a sound that honours her diverse taste.\r\n\r\nIn Spring 2016, Nicola released her sophomore EP, No Place to Call, recorded at Hamilton's Catherine North Studios with producer Dan Hosh (Wild Rivers, Rose Cousins) and mastered by Elliott Brood's Stephen Pitkin. The five-song EP is a move to a sound that Nicola feels fully defines her as an artist. On a base level, the songs are what many have come to know and love from Canadian folk music, but the vocal delivery and heavy instrumentation set Nicola apart. Throughout the recording, she employs the use of heavy textures and ambience coupled with emotionally-charged lyrics and vocal delivery.\r\n\r\n"No Place to Call is a work focused on atmosphere: I want the listener to feel as though they are surrounded by colour, while simultaneously allowing them to really feel the emotion that is clear in the songs." Nicola, 2016\r\n\r\nThe title, No Place to Call refers to a lack of being able to call anyone, or any place, home - a theme that is highly present throughout the recording. While at times it may be 'pretty,' No Place to Call is anything but that: it is charged with emotion, grit and vulnerability.\r\n\r\nSince the release of No Place to Call in April 2016, Nicola has completed three tours in Canada and has performed in Nashville, TN.\r\n\r\nA classically trained vocalist, Nicola’s 2013 EP Chasing the Wind, was nominated for two Hamilton Music Awards (Best New Artist/Group, Alt-Country Recording of the Year) and the Toronto Independent Music Awards (Best Folk). Nicola has made many high-profile appearances, including: the JUNO Concert Series, The Love Song Edition and Hamilton’s Supercrawl. Nicola was a Regional Finalist in the 2015 CBC Searchlight Competition and was selected for the Canadian Independent Recording Artist’s Association’s Mentorship Program, where she received one-on-one mentorship with Livy Jeanne (Black Box Records, Universal Music) over the summer of 2015.

1299	Tackling topics like mental illness, loss, heartbreak, estrangement, and countless others, Danielle Knibbe has developed a following by being as genuine and open in her songwriting as she is onstage. Her songs invite the listener into what feels like an intimate conversation between friends. Her knack for penning insightful yet straightforward lyrics has already gained her recognition, earning her a spot at the Banff Centre for the Arts inaugural Singer-Songwriter Residency. Although she was one of the youngest songwriters in the program, she was given the nickname “The Lyric Doctor” due to her natural instinct for getting  to the heart of a song.\r\n\r\nHer sophomore album The Ribcage & The Heart (Spring 2019) is full of examples of Danielle’s lyrical skill,with three of the songs having been selected for print in American Songwriter’s monthly lyric contest. This new album, mixed by Howard Bilerman (Arcade Fire, Basia Bulat) and featuring Fats Kaplin (John Prine, Jack White), showcases the depth, insight, passion, and potential of this up-and-coming songwriter.

591	The Utilities are an Alberta-based folk rock band. “Heavy South,” their newest and best record, fixates on circular patterns: work weeks, weather patterns, daily exchanges. Melodic, lyrically-focused songs are the heart and soul of the record, with gently psychedelic flourishes and instrumental detours adding colour. The Utilities sound relaxed and confident on “Heavy South,” refining the strengths of their previous releases. These are the warmest recordings the band have released to date; with the help of Albertan producer Jesse Northey (Major Love, Jesse and the Dandelions), The Utilities dig into sounds of the late 60s and early 70s more seriously than on their previous releases. "Heavy South" is an inviting record that rewards repeated listens.\r\n\r\nThe Utilities are Joel Stretch, Drake McCheyne, Colby Stolson, and Tyson Wiebe.

98	After beginning a musical performance journey 15 years ago, which included 600 performances and a 6-year hiatus from consistent professional music work, I’m ready to go bigger.\n\nBigger means the popular music market. Whether its a solo acoustic performance or with a full band, the original and cover songs are for large and not-quite-as-large audiences, whether live or recorded. Bigger means a great brand, great partnerships with music businesses, and great fans. Fans can expect to interact with me through many online and live mediums, so that we can all create the biggest music community possible.\n\nI founded an alternative rock band in 2001 that went on to release 2 full length albums. The debut album was nominated for two awards at a peoples choice awards show. The band performed over 150 times in Western Canada for over 10,000 people. Our notable bookings included Trooper, Jars of Clay, Family Force 5, and Kutless. Much of my experience in the music industry has come from training and networking from this group.\n\nIn the time that I decided to build my early music career, I got really involved in the business, management, and education sides of the music industry. The Gospel Music Association of Canada had me stage manage their annual awards show one year. Over 100 students have come through the guitar and vocal studios that I’ve taught at, and some of them went on to be recording artists themselves. I have also directed music programs at churches, and do marketing consulting for artists.

122	Both an esteemed contemporary folk singer-songwriter and an accomplished yoga teacher, Calgary’s Amy Thiessen\ncombines her passions for music and healing into Project Sundari a one-of-a-kind live music experience – captured\nalso on record – that deftly avoids new age tropes.\nEquipped with a guitar, keyboard, simple drum machine and loop pedal, Amy collaborates with other yoga teachers,\nwho lead classes through a sequence of postures while Amy performs partially-improvised, trip hop-inspired riffs on\nboth traditional and original devotional music.\nHer work features traditional AND original mantras in Sanskrit and English combined with trip hop; tastefully\nsynthesized atmospheres; organic piano and guitar and pure authentic folk vocals. The record version presents the\nwork in a conventional song format, while the live version sees Amy improvise around a basic structure.\nAmy comes from a contemporary folk and pop background, where innovation and originality are the litmus tests of\ngreatness, and her combined backgrounds in music and healing have always been her calling card. She is known\nfor beautifully cliché-free original songs that explored spiritual and emotional depths; her ability to wrestle fearlessly\nand comfortably with her shadows earned her wide acclaim.\nCBC host Russell Bowers wrote that “an Amy Thiessen performance is an hypnotic blend of words and music that is\nat once spiritual and fun.” FFWD wrote, “It’s rare that a musician will push the limits of their respective genre while\nstill promoting a relaxed atmosphere.”	["music"]	["folk","singer-songwriter"]	\N	me@amythiessen.com	Amy Thiessen	\N	me@amythiessen.com	f	\N	\N	2018-06-08 06:51:28.876+00	\N	\N	\N	[{"mediaType":"website","url":"http://www.amythiessen.com"}]	\N	\N	\N	originals	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

774	"Life Seems Absurd Below Clouds" is Jo Bergeron's third instalment of introspective odes to the lost and lonely but forever hopeful guy next door. As always, whether singing about loving ghosts in "Please Miss Phantom Heart" or the freezing desolate loner in "Emaciated Sun", Jo explores the emotional gamut of love & loss, with his heart on his sleeve.\r\n\r\n"Life Seems Absurd Below Clouds" is the long awaited follow-up to Jo’s One Week Record, recorded in San Francisco in 2014 with punk rock legend Joey Cape, leader of Californian band Lagwagon.\r\n\r\nDuring an extensive and critically acclaimed, one-guitar-one-suitcase solo European Tour covering 6 countries (Germany, France, Austria, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland) in 2015 to promote his One Week record, Jo began stitching together the 10 new songs that became the new album.\r\n\r\nUpon his return home, and in between North American dates sharing the stage with Joey Cape, Chris Cresswell (The Flatliners), and other One Week record Alumni, Jo teamed up yet again with lyricist Vann Delorey (Pascale Picard, The Seasons) for a series of writing sessions to finish up the new collection of songs in an old barn around a worn out poker table.\r\n\r\nThe result is some of the finest gems Jo has released to date. Recorded entirely in Quebec City and produced by Jo & Jee Côté, Jo delivers "Life Seems Absurd Below Clouds" in the signature acoustic style his fans know, love and expect, guitar and voice up front wide open, while opening new doors with unexpected orchestral and electronic flourishes and experimentation.\r\n\r\n"Life Seems Absurd Below Clouds" is a must for all fans of authentic folk punk troubadours.\r\nThe Album will be released officially on vinyl during Montreal’s Pouzza Fest and simultaneously available via all digital outlets on May 19th 2018.

He has played Folk / Blues / Jazz festivals and concert halls and clubs from Halifax, to Vancouver Island, to the Yukon.\n\nInspired by the Hillbilly and Western Swing music he heard as a child, Tim absorbed late Fifties Rhythm & Blues and Rock & Roll, Hawaiian and Mexican music, early Sixties Folk, and Bluegrass “like a sponge” before discovering a passion for traditional blues styles which was fueled by seeing many first generation blues musicians live during the “Blues Boom” of the mid and late Sixties.”	["music"]	["singer-songwriter","blues"]	\N	\N	\N	\N	dtwcayuse@shaw.ca	f	\N	2017-07-18 23:03:51.39+00	2021-02-19 00:28:55.04+00	\N	\N	[]	[{"mediaType":"website","url":"https://www.cayusemusic.com"}]	\N	\N	\N	originals	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

MacKay’s country-ish songs are standouts, riddled with one-liners that catch the sun like a freshly polished cleaver. \r\n\r\nNow living in Calgary, he has become an artist to watch, being nominated for Roots/Folk Recording of the Year and Male Artist of the Year at the upcoming Calgary Music Awards. MacKay’s newest offering “Twin” (produced by Leeroy Stagger) features fiddle, banjo and the haunting harmonies of his twin brother, Ben.\r\n\r\nMacKay has a vibrato, thanks to his affinity for crooner vocalists, which gives him even more of an antique feel, like he just stepped out of a bus straight from the 1940's. - Bob Mersereau - CBC - East Coast Music \r\n\r\nMacKay is equal parts deep voiced crooner and delicately annunciated soul. There is a certain smokiness and sensual feel to his voice, almost a whisper at points. It warms you up deep in the chest as he sings out his songs. A little bit Roy Orbison and a little bit Keegan Dewitt, Nashville songwriter. - Red Line Roots (redlineroots.ca) \r\n\r\nIf you are looking for a performer to provide an unforgettable evening of song, stories, laughter and impeccable musicianship, Scott MacKay is the artist for you. - Rhea March – Artist Development Specialist – March Music & The School of Song.

38	During the summer of 2014, Calgary ’s Edworthy Park was a convenient place to jam.  What banjo player Nathan H-Thompson and guitarist Ben Rogalsky didn’t expect, was for passers-by to take interest in their music and start giving them money.  As the coins and album requests added up, these accidental buskers decided to take this seriously and Steel & Timber was born.  Within a short time, their energetic performances earned them invitations to farmers markets, small festivals, charity events, and private functions in Calgary and the surrounding area.  In March 2015, the trio released their debut EP, Home Brew, which boosted their popularity and allowed them to become regional finalists in CBC Searchlight 2015.  \n\n2016 brought continued success for Steel & Timber.  They made news headlines after being selected by the City of Calgary, to perform on the C-Train to kick off Juno Week.  Summer highlights included performances at the Southern Alberta Music Festival, Taste the Trucks, The Rosebud Music Festival, and the Foothills Folk Club seasonal kick off.  Steel & Timber is looking forward to their first studio release in 2017.\n\nSteel & Timber’s sound could be classified as alternative folk and roots.  Influenced by groups like the Avett Brothers, the Strumbellas, and Josh Ritter, Steel & Timber has found a sound that is exciting, accessible, and makes people dance!  \n\n"The first time I heard Steel & Timber play live was for a food bank fundraiser in June 2015. When I saw that upright bass, banjo, and guitar, I knew I was going to fall in love. And indeed I did! I couldn’t sit still for the entire set! It's impossible to listen to this band without clapping your hands, stomping your feet, and grinning. Talented musicians and just incredibly great guys. I predict big things for Steel & Timber!" \n\n-Jenny Howe, CBC	["music"]	["folk","singer-songwriter"]	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	2018-06-08 06:51:28.865+00	\N	\N	\N	[{"mediaType":"website","url":"http://www.steel-and-timber.com/"}]	\N	\N	\N	originals	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
1589	‘I don’t really feel the doubt, I just wanna sing it loud’ says Canadian-born Mike Edel in his new single Hello Universe arriving June 23rd. Edel delivers an uptempo summer anthem laden with melodic hooks, and the positivity we need now: inviting us to ‘turn your back’ to the negative and embrace the gratification and simple joy our individual paths through life offer.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMixed by Marcus Paquin (Arcade Fire, The National) and co-written with Parker Bossley, the accompanying music video is a must see. Shot over 5 days in Morocco in early March 2020,  Edel and filmmaker Jordan Clarke barely made it home in the wake of the global pandemic.\r\n\r\n‘It was a whirlwind video shoot and I connected through Paris. A little French macaroon lady told me I was lucky I was flying today because the European/USA borders were closing tomorrow.’ said Edel.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe summer single is a follow up to Edel’s Chris Walla (Death Cab For Cutie) produced 2019 record, THRESHOLDS. After THRESHOLDS, 4 million cumulative streams across major platforms, landing a song on ABC’s American Idol, in heavy rotation on CBC Music, AAA Radio across the United States, and on Sirius XM’s The Verge and North Americana; after playing hundreds of shows across North American and Europe including Rifflandia Festival, Vancouver Folk Festival, Regina Folk Festival, Victoria International Jazz Festival, and Upstream Music Festival; after sharing the stage with Serena Ryder, Foy Vance, Said The Whale and Josh Garrels; and after moving to Seattle, WA and getting married, Edel has established himself as a creative tour de force with plenty on the horizon.

484	Don’t let the relative youth of Clayton & Joelle (Clayton Parsons and Joelle Winkel) fool you—they are old souls with a sound that transcends time. Their genuine country-roots style is reminiscent of the ‘60’s American folk revival scene that birthed Joan Baez, Emmylou Harris, Pete Seeger, and Peter, Paul & Mary. \r\n\r\nParsons grew up with music as a constant and he counts his parents and seven siblings as his primary musical influences. Along with his dad’s rendition of James Taylor songs, Parsons also listened to plenty of Fleetwood Mac, the Beatles, Neil Young and Nickel Creek. He played solo and with numerous bands in his hometown of Cranbrook, B.C., before joining alt-folk band The Good Ol’ Goats, and meeting vocalist Winkel—and falling in love with her voice, and then the singer herself. Winkel was surrounded by song as a child, and began singing with church and school choirs, musical theatre productions and at community events. She was influenced by old gospel songs and traditional hymns as much as she was by classic rock and alternative artists. And when she and Parsons finally met, their chemistry—musical and personal—was undeniable. When their previous band went on hiatus, Clayton & Joelle emerged.\r\n\r\nWhile still in the early days of their musical partnership, Clayton & Joelle have won fans wherever they’ve travelled. Parsons’s lyrics are an authentic representation of his often wide-eyed wonder at the world, finding joy in the simple things and profundity in what many of us take for granted. The duo doesn’t rely on heavy instrumentation to underscore the sweetness of their honey-warmed harmonies; Parsons’s skill at finger picking provides the perfect thread for Winkel’s exquisite voice to weave its way around, creating an uncomplicated but gorgeous tapestry of music. \r\n\r\nThe deftness of their singing and songwriting has not gone unsung: the recently engaged duo were recognized by the Kootenay Music Awards with the Album of the Year for their debut release in 2016. Live, their sweet and soulful music is punctuated with stories behind the songs, inside jokes that the whole audience becomes a part of and true generosity of spirit.

1221	The best way to create art you love is to work with those you admire. That’s exactly what Victoria-based artist Dylan Perkons did on his upcoming debut, The Healing Day, and the result is a collection of richly orchestral songs that tell the story of an experienced songwriter finally stepping out to record under his own name. Perkons has spent his career working on various projects, honing his craft both on the road and in the studio, so while The Healing Day is his first solo outing, it represents a much longer journey.\r\n\r\nPerkons knew early on he wanted to work with producer, Jonas Bonnetta of Ontario folk-outfit Evening Hymns, and had the privilege of recording at his secluded Port William Sound in Mountain Grove, ON. The woods were the perfect backdrop for an album that required, above all else, space. While the album was largely performed by Perkons and Bonnetta, The Healing Day also features a handful of Canadian indie mainstays like Michael Feuerstack (Snailhouse,The Luyas), Pietro Amato (The Luyas), Edwin Huizinga (The Wooden Sky), and Lisa Conway (L CON).\r\n\r\nThe album draws influence from Canadian folk songwriters that have come before him and while Perkons’ familiarity is comforting, he uses it as the foundation for his atmospheric indie-pop. The opening instrumental track feels like dawn, bringing listeners immediately into the woods before Perkons’ deep baritone breaks in, beginning the album’s tellings of imperfect, but meaningful, love. The songs move through relatable despair, knowing sometimes love must be set free in order to grow. There are also moments of reprieve where it is easy to imagine an audience singing along to the chorus in “Love Like Mine”. The album finishes with “Halfway to Winnipeg” where Perkons cultivates hope in the midst of self-deprecating sincerity.\r\n\r\nThe Healing Day is best described as layered. These are earnest, well-crafted songs, brimming with strings, french horn, electric piano and a plethora of synthesizers, creating a distinctive universe for the listener, one they will want to visit over and over again.

1	The T. Buckley Trio deliver soulful laments and gritty truths, wrapped in a cowboy blanket to create a distinct western Canadian flavour. This Calgary trio has been turning heads since they first came onto scene in 2010 with their twist on "a little bit country and a little bit rock and roll."\n\n T. Buckley acts as the trio's  lead vocalist and principle songwriter; Derek Pulliam, on stand-up bass and vocals and Tim Leacock on electric guitar, mandolin and vocals. The band brings a more-than memorable stage presence and harmonies that create a sound much larger than their modest stage set up.

718	Young James is an indie rock band from Saskatoon, Canada. Young James began in 2006 as an outlet for songwriters T.C. Young and Davy James. Their songs incorporate elements of rock, folk, alt-country and indie sounds. The group pulls inspiration from acts such as Neil Young and Crazy Horse, Tom Petty, Sweethearts of the Rodeo-era Byrds, and often draws comparisons with Cuff the Duke, Elliott Brood, The Jayhawks and Canadian songwriting masters Blue Rodeo.\r\n\r\nT.C. Young and Davy James had been fans of each others work as their paths had crossed many times in Saskatoon's indie music scene in the 1990s. By the turn of the century, both writers were spread out across Canada pursuing various musical endeavours. By 2006, both artists had relocated to Saskatoon and continued to hone their songwriting skills. A chance encounter saw the two sharing musical ideas around a campfire and Young James was born. The group released their self-titled debut album "Young James" in 2008 with the follow-up, "Cruel Times" in 2012.\r\n\r\nRecorded over the winter of 2016, their latest EP "Hard Way Road" is filled with prairie imagery, catchy melodies and a healthy dose of twang and grit. The Saskatoon group draws inspiration from their hometown's isolating prairie winters, and long, hot summer evenings, offering tightly packaged songs with meaningful content.

What this artist has first and foremost is staying power. He does not re-invent himself to suit the current climate. Instead, Cameron has steadily built a career that started as an ace guitarist in rock bands, to a valued sideman, to frontman, to the singer-songwriter. His soul is anchored in his Cape Breton upbringing, Cameron brings to his music a riveting mix of styles, running the full gamut from folk and roots right up to blues-rock.\r\n\r\nThe credentials came quickly for Cameron, who ﬁrst garnered national attention winning the Much Music Guitar Warz competition in 1990, leading to several appearances with Jeff Healey. His collaborating with Jully Black resulted in a song on her Juno award-winning album Revival. In 2007, he garnered Toronto Exclusive Magazine Awards: ‘Best Blues Artist’; ‘Best Blues Song’ for “Sueanna”; and ‘Artist of the Year’. From the BMG label, he received a platinum sales award for co-writing on Canadian Idol Winner Ryan Malcolm's Home album. In 2016, "Sueanna" wins big again at the Edmonton Music Awards for "Best Blues Recording".\r\n\r\nCameron considered himself fortunate to be a special guest and guitar slinger for the late venerated blues icon Long John Baldry. His playing with Baldry on the international festival circuit was lauded and complimented by such legendary artists as JJ Cale .\r\n\r\n\r\n	["music"]	[]	\N	\N	Bobby Cameron	7802389956	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1591801885/artist/1558/cover_photo.png	2020-06-10 15:10:47.646+00	2020-06-10 15:12:58.831+00	\N	\N	[{"index":0,"publicId":"artist/1558/hi-res/0.jpg","version":1591801912},{"index":1,"publicId":"artist/1558/hi-res/1.jpg","version":1591801928},{"index":2,"publicId":"artist/1558/hi-res/2.jpg","version":1591801977}]	[{"mediaType":"embeddedYoutube","url":"https://youtu.be/0hrWGkxjaqA"},{"mediaType":"youtubeChannel","url":"https://www.youtube.com/user/bobbycamerontv"},{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/bobbycameronmusic"},{"mediaType":"twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/bobbycameron"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"https://bobbycameron.com"},{"mediaType":"spotify","url":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/1JDl9nlfg0i8EQDk7Q6hZz"},{"mediaType":"appleMusic","url":"https://music.apple.com/ca/artist/bobby-cameron/151202621"},{"mediaType":"soundCloud","url":"https://soundcloud.com/bobbycameronmusic"},{"mediaType":"bandcampArtist","url":"https://bobbycameron.bandcamp.com"},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"http://bobbycameron.bandcamp.com/track/in-the-light-of-day","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"2504936941"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://bobbycameron.bandcamp.com/track/perfect-world","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"4187449141"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://bobbycameron.bandcamp.com/track/sueanna","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"816175707"}}]	“He isn't looking for his musical identity, he knows who he is.

He sang at school.

268	Hi Ambur Bosi here! (Or OPAL) I am a singer/songwriter from Toronto and now based out of Calgary. I finished a program called Independent Music and Performance at SAIT- York Uni, there I learned a lot about being self sufficient in my art, and a ton of Vocal anatomy/performance. It is important to know I love cats, teaching vocals and collaborating with other local artists. I speak up for myself, but keep it respectful. I am very enthusiastic about the arts in this city!

785	Archaics are a four-piece psychedelic art-rock band from Edmonton, Alberta. Their experimental tastes create a cavorting atmosphere that accompanies one through thoughts of kaleidoscopic hysteria; a tangible swing from a twisted frame of mind. \r\n\r\nTheir most recent album, Soft Focus (2016 - Sweety Pie Records) is carefully orchestrated, displaying the chemistry developed over nine years of playing together. Guided by the precise ear of producer/audio engineer Renny Wilson (Mint Records) the album captures a delicate progression in the band’s stylistic expression. Elements of Nigerian Afrobeat, Latin drumming, and the free-roamings of old-time jazz moved the songs away from the safety of the defining sounds of the modern psychedelic-garage revival. Wilson pushed the band to embed intricate subtleties more deeply into each track, allowing swells of innate dynamics to add far reaching dimensions to the album. Experimentation with a diverse array of instrumentation including horns, keys, and clarinet, shine through the movements. Soft Focus premiered online on Slovenia’s Psychedelic Baby Magazine and was reviewed by Sandra Sperounes of the Edmonton Journal, who rated it four out of five stars. Features with Vue Weekly and Beatroute Magazine brought further attention to the album and helped it receive airplay on radio stations across the country. \r\n\r\n“Archaics [Soft Focus] as a whole come off as scruffier, clangier and more mystical — not to mention more tangential! — than their ’60s predecessors”  - Sandra Sperounes - Edmonton Journal July 2016\r\n\r\nThe past three years have consisted of notable presence and recognition within the Canadian arts community with opening slots for bands such as July Talk, Dan Deacon, The Dandy Warhols, SUUNS, and Dead Meadow. Actively introducing their caravanning circus to curious ears, the band has completed two tours across Canada and performed at festivals including UP+DT, Big Winter Classic, Vancouver Psych Fest, and Golden West Music Fest. Frequent performances in Saskatoon, Calgary, Lethbridge and Vancouver throughout 2016 inspired the booking of an extensive touring schedule throughout Canada in 2017.\r\n\r\nFilming and recording of the Soft Focus release show was funded by the Edmonton Art Council’s MicroGrant program and allowed for the allure of the evening to be captured. A live video of the song “Nova Swing” from that evening was released in January of 2017. Prior to the release of Soft Focus, Archaics released a split cassette with Montreal psych outfit Pachyderm in June 2016 on both Sweety Pie Records and Montreal label, Brothers & Sisters Records. Other releases from the band include a full length album, Archaics S/T (2014) and a split cassette with Edmonton Neo-folk group, James of Dark Wood (2014). \r\n\r\nArchaics are currently recording their third full-length album at Edmonton’s Audio Department studio with producers/audio engineers Nik Kozub and Dean Kheroufi. Funding for this album has been provided through the Alberta Foundation for the Arts’ Artist Project Grant program. Following the recording of this album, Archaics will be touring throughout Western Canada and the USA in Spring 2019. \r\n\r\nArchaics consists of Connor Snell (Vox, Guitar), Josh Beatty (Vox, Guitar), Elijah Browning (Drums), and Peter Masson (Bass)	["music"]	[]	Our typical audience consists of people aged 16-40.

642	:Vancouver Island raised alt-rock artist, Alexandria Maillot, is carving her name in to the Canadian music landscape with the help of her debut full-length, Time, released on June 10, 2016. At 25 years, Alexandria Maillot's gritted, inflective vocals and lyrical narratives have often drawn her comparisons to music heavyweights such as Feist, Loretta Lynn and Alabama Shake's Brittany Howard, and “Time” has proven to be a body of work that has merited national radio attention and widespread critical acclaim amongst industry peers and music lovers alike. \r\nPerforming since the age of 7, the Vancouver Island's resume is as colourful as her genre-blending timbre, including credits like being scouted by David Foster at age 12, working with Randy Bachman, and even being featured on the Oprah Winfrey network. Other credits include: Publishing songs with international artists (Stefanie Heinzmann) and TV/Film (Young and the Restless, MTV’s World of Jenks, Hallmark’s Heart of Spring, Nancy Grace, Chesapeake Shores); winning several accolades (Shore 104.3’s Best of BC $10,000 grant, LG $5,000 VanCover contest); being featured on numerous music platforms (American Airlines In-Flight Entertainment, Virgin Radio’s Best of BC program, Peak Performance Project Top 20 finalist); performing at numerous festivals (Rifflandia, Vancouver Island Music Fest, Riverfest Elora, Tiny Lights, Iceland Airwaves) and touring extensively across Canada and the EU.

136	Hot on the heels of a jam-packed 2016 performing at events such as Big Valley Jamboree, Country Thunder and - the ‘Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth’ - the Calgary Stampede, Tanya Ryan turns her attention back to her first love: writing songs and making music.  The young artist heads back into the studio with Mark Troyer at Evergreen Sound.\n \nAfter earning almost every competition title in Alberta - taking the crown in Calgary Stampede's Nashville North Star Contest (2012), Ponoka Stampede Talent Competition (2012) and Country 105's Rising Star Competition (2011) – Tanya Ryan has developed a signature style on-stage that audiences find difficult to ignore. Her dominant presence, solid vocals, and her witty banter have earned her the respect of audiences across Western Canada and in the music industry as a whole. These successes have lead to high profile national showcase opportunities with CMT Canada (2013) and the Canadian Country Music Association’s (CCMA) Discovery Program (2014).  Don Green, CCMA President says of Ryan, “…She adds personality to her songs; her songwriting is very unique. She has a great sound …” CCMA Award winning artist, Gord Bamford says, “[Tanya Ryan] has a unique sound, unlike anyone else… [she’s] an original.”\n\nTanya has opened for fellow Canadians Dallas Smith, High Valley, Aaron Lines, Bobby Wills, Aaron Pritchett, Tim Hicks and Duane Steele as well as American favourite The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. The release of her single, Cry for the Devil, came with a powerful music video directed by multi-CCMA Award Nominee Troy Niemans; and was followed shortly thereafter by the title track of her debut EP Simple As That which was released to radio in 2015.\nAway from music Tanya spends time working with The Rowan House Emergency Shelter, enjoys the challenge of a hike in the mountains and likes to stay actively involved in her home community in the Alberta Foothills.

String sections, a cacophonous blend of noise, and heavily layered vocal harmonies push accessible pop hooks into more psychedelically complex and intriguing harmonic territory that rewards repeat listeners by continuing to engage them.\r\n\r\n“True Blue is a thoughtful, evocative album that grows in appreciation on successive spins. In the simplest terms, it’s a dreamy pop record that ventures into the realm of the psychedelic.\r\n\r\nHighlighted by compelling, layered instrumentation, coded ethereal lyrics and the occasional jangly guitar—True Blue leaves a lingering effect that is challenging and satisfying.  Elegant harmonies drift throughout the record, summoning memories of late Beatles records crossed with early ’90s college-radio lyrics” – Vue Weekly\r\n\r\nThe band has been very active in Western Canada with success on CBC and campus community radio, as well as great opening slots for bands like Attack In Black, Hollerado,Said the Whale and July Talk.

Pawluk (Beatroute Magazine)\r\n\r\nFitness is an art punk band from Edmonton, Alberta concerned with human form, the commodification of self, and the slipperiness of membership.

On February 22nd, Fitness released their debut full-length -ing, which quickly rose to the top of CJSR’s charts (among other college/community radio stations across Canada) and has had a steady number of chart appearances since then.

170	Madison Nicol is a 22 year old singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist from Regina, Canada. Enrolled in piano lessons before he was in kindergarten, music has always been a constant presence in Madison's life. He excelled in both practical and written exams through the Royal Conservatory of Music, but his musical life was forever changed when he took up the guitar at age 13. Primarily self-taught, Madison played in bar bands with his friends, opening up for touring acts when they would pass through Regina. At 17, he set off on a different path after hearing James Taylor's "Carolina In My Mind" for the first time. Madison began writing and recording his own songs, often pulling all-nighters before heading to school in the morning.\n\nWhen he was 18, Madison moved to Los Angeles and enrolled at Musicians Institute as a  Bachelor of Music student. While there, he was exposed to a number of new musical styles as he learned from some of the best musicians in the world. It was in Los Angeles that he began taking vocal lessons in preparation for his audition for Berklee College of Music. These lessons would prove to be another turning point. Accepted to Berklee on scholarship, Madison majored in songwriting, where he learned the nuances of composition and lyric writing. While at Berklee, Madison successfully auditioned for one of the student bluegrass ensembles. He was quickly ushered into a new world of vocal harmonies and instrumental abilities, singing lead in the group's three and four part harmonies and taking "breaks" as a guitarist. Madison gleaned a number of pearls of wisdom from his stage performance class with Livingston Taylor (brother of his hero James), including "If you haven't heard, you've heard. It’s no." and "The audience is not your problem. They are your salvation".\n\nUpon returning from Boston for the summer, Madison began writing a number of songs implementing the knowledge he had acquired in the past year. After choosing four of them to make up his debut EP, he started recording in the fall and released the EP in January of 2016. He released his second EP in August of 2016 and is currently preparing his third EP for release. In between the writing and recording of these EPs, Madison has played a number of shows at various venues throughout Regina.

380	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\r\nMIRA BLACK REDEFINES JAZZ WITH MESH OF SUBTLE RHYTHMS, COMPELLING COMPOSITIONS, A DASH OF SPOKEN WORD & INTENSELY AFFECTING VOCALS\r\n\r\nAsk most artists to characterize their musical persona, and you’re often saddled with, “I sound like no one else. I am unique.” Singer/songwriter Mira Black, however, is wholly obliging to offer a take on her sonic signature: “Sade's energy meets Joni Mitchell's poetry and the heart of Nina Simone” she says. “Then take those three to Cirque du Soleil and you've got a taste of me.”\r\nOn second thought, perhaps Black—whose upcoming album, “Mira,” veers to the left of any neatly defined musical genre—is indeed that rare artist that defies convention. Produced by iconic Chicago House Music legend Vince Lawrence, the set’s 14 tracks are founded in ambient electronica, but stripped down into sparse stop-and-start beats that trickle, ooze and percolate, ultimately allowing her potent vocals and intimate lyrics to rise to the surface. "She's a jazz musician at heart and a revolutionary by function but Mira is pure poet at the core."\r\n“Getting to the core of Mira’s philosophies became our mission,” says Lawrence, whose long string of credits includes co-writing the first House Music hit, 1984’s “On and On,” and the founding of seminal Trax Records. “We started with a rough electronic sketch, but as I heard her sing and saw the poetry in her lyrics—how emotional every word is—I wanted to stay away from too many beats. We ultimately shaped something that is subtle and immersive, where you hear every word she’s saying. It distills past any fluff and is profoundly touching.”\r\n“Mira” will be released early next year on Chicago based "Slang Recordings", with first single “I Remember Love” launching in the fall. The moody, contemplative song opens with the telling lyric, “I remember when someone thought I was the one...” Mira explains, “The message is to never let the moment pass, not to get jumbled in the things that don’t matter. Don’t miss any opportunity to find true love.”\r\nLike most of her compositions, the message summons Mira’s life experiences. “John Lennon had it right when he sang, ‘Love is all you need.’ Some call me naïve or an innocent, but I believe it’s that simple,” she says. “Writing this record was about purging as a mechanism to perpetuate growth. Those experiences provided tools for authentic analysis and lessons around heartbreak and love.” She adds with a laugh: “My formula for writing: Fall madly in love and get your heart pulled out through your nose.”\r\nAs her umbrella theme, Black asks what could be more apropos than the universal theme of love? “Come on, I’m not a soldier, a teacher or a politician. I’m not a mother or a religious leader. I have no illusions that I’m powerful enough to change the world and unite religions. So let’s talk about the moment, this moment, the truth of this moment. Let’s skip the small talk about a ‘more than this’ kind of love. Let’s explore authentic connection.”\r\nHer life’s journey also adds to Black’s connection with heart-driven lyrics. With an intellectually based father from East India and a free-spirited Scottish mother, she was raised around the globe: in India, Canada, the West Indies and America. “As a nomadic child, I’ve had the opportunity to gain a greater understanding of the human condition,” she says. “I go back to India every few years and see a very different portrait of humanity. Ironically, now I find myself back in Chicago fulfilling my dream, where I spent many of my formative years. This has all allowed me to maintain an open mind.”\r\nBlack also brings a diverse past musical life to her current work. In the early 1990s, she toured with popular Canadian folk act Acoustically Inclined. Ironically, the group started as an instrumental ensemble, until members heard Black in the audience spontaneously singing aloud to their melodies. They invited her onstage—eventually to become the group’s vocalist. “I was the one woman traveling with these five cats,” touring folk, pop and jazz festivals, she says. “It was through that experience that I learned to appreciate a more avant garde sound and composition.”\r\nHer 2013 self titles album was nominated for a Western Canadian Music award for best album. In addition, in 2008, Black released the solo jazz-infused “Live At The Moment,” whose influence peaks through on “Mira,” thanks to her inclusion of organic instrumentation like cello and piano, tabla, alongside the synthesizers and electronic pulses.\r\n“Working together changed both Vince and me as artists. This record is an experience of two creative spirits from diverse backgrounds painting a beautiful tapestry together,” Black notes. “I sang my melodies and lyrics and he added computer-based brush strokes that complement the sound without hijacking it.”\r\nLawrence adds, “The very definition of music is ‘organized sound over time.’ Mira and I discarded the traditional rules of chord progression. This is sound design, with the musical elements building from Mira’s vocals and lyrics. We drilled beyond the BS to a basic core message.”\r\nAn ideal example is the track “Illusion,” whose essence was born after Black fell in love with a man averse to the risks of commitment because he saw how people could belittle love to a series of physical impulses. She wrote the lyric and melody over Lawrence’s cool swirl of cascading, slowly building blips and beats, singing, “A butterfly consumed by the warmth of his cocoon/The sky awaits, longing to hear your song/But don’t wait too long… or when you get there I’ll be gone/Don’t tell me love is an illusion.”\r\n“Don’t Leave Yet,” on the other hand, is a lamenting look back at failing to appreciate the love one has. Black sings, “I miss the call just to say hello, the call to make sure I know”; while “Crazy” celebrates sexual craving, accompanied by an insistent electronic force field, as she bursts into the chorus of “Be my fantasy, holding back nothing, let’s be crazy.”\r\nIn all, while Black may sing about those feelings and experiences we all endure in life, “Mira” is at once daring and experimental, as the album envelops her mighty talent with an unexpected, surprisingly warm harmonic embrace—one she hopes to share any way she can.\r\n“My dream, plain and simple, is to sing,” Black says. “Whether I come to your house and sing while we cook or if I’m performing on television or at a beautiful open-air festival communing with an audience, it’s where I feel the most authentic place inside myself. Music is absolutely where I find my personal sense of divinity.”	["music"]	["jazz","roots","singer-songwriter","soul"]	Jazz fans, poetry nerds, spiritual seekers and open hearted music lovers. 	\N	Mira Black	204-899-3921	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1517604031/artist/380/cover_photo.jpg	2018-02-02 20:39:58.272+00	2019-09-21 21:07:17.319+00	Negotiable at booking	[{"name":"Winnipeg Jazz Festival","date":"2017/06"},{"name":"Lolitas Lounge ","date":"2017/05"},{"name":"Jazz YYC Festival ","date":"2016/06"}]	[{"index":0,"publicId":"artist/380/hi-res/0.jpg","version":1555513130},{"index":1,"publicId":"artist/380/hi-res/1.png","version":1555513161},{"index":2,"publicId":"artist/380/hi-res/2.jpg","version":1555513205}]	[{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/mirablackofficial/"},{"mediaType":"twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/mirablackmusic"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/mirablackmusic"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"http://www.mirablack.com"},{"mediaType":"embeddedYoutube","url":"https://youtu.be/tGeYwN3cVDY"},{"mediaType":"youtubeChannel","url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKHK_JXwonXHw0q6MWT0-EQ?view_as=subscriber"}]	Mira Black Live!	singer-songwriter	["jazz","pop"]	originals	\N	tGeYwN3cVDY	\N	\N	\N

A\r\nperfect album for airplay as it touches on different genres and the hooks stick in your\r\nhead for days.

All of the songs on the album are.\r\n\r\nSinger-songwriter Ryan Hicks has been hard at work for three years on his new album, Pulsing\r\nColours. The album is a concept record of all of the the thoughts, moods and emotions that can\r\ncome to us at night.\r\n\r\nPulsing Colours is a star-studded record featuring Ryan as well as drummer Jeff Romanyk (Rah\r\nRah), Michael Dawson (Library Voices), Amy Nelson (solo country singer, currently with a Top Ten\r\ncountry single in Australia) and more. The record is a hard-hitting album featuring memorable\r\nmelodies, rich sonic landscape and lyrical depth.\r\n\r\nThe record was inspired and written in tribute to Ryan’s step-mother, who took her own life in\r\nDecember, 2014. Her loss made Ryan dig inward and look for meaning and his place in the world.\r\nWhile the album deals with loss, it also gives a message of community, survival, love and hope.\r\nPulsing Colours is a record about all of us finding our way in the universe.\r\n\r\nThe sound is gritty, honest, emotional and will to appeal to an audience who loves acts such as\r\nHarry Nilsson, The Arcade Fire and Neil Young. Ryan attended Pitchfork Music Festival and hearing\r\nbands like Chvrches, Sleeter Kinney, The New Pornographers and Run The Jewels live had a big\r\ninfluence on this record. Ryan was also inspired by the work of filmmaker David Lynch, especially\r\nthe TV show Twin Peaks. Ryan loves the moods, atmosphere, spirituality, humour and wonder of\r\nthe world of Twin Peaks.\r\n\r\nSeeing success from albums such as Neil Young’s Harvest, The Fleet Foxes three records and\r\nFather John Misty’s I Love You Honeybear shows that similar approaches can be both artistic\r\nrewarding and appeal to a large audience. The songs are heartfelt with inspired performances by\r\nall players.\r\n\r\nA link to the EPK containing hi-res pictures, information about the songs, musicians, stories behind\r\nthe individual songs and more can be found here:\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/77or924z04u1uop/AACQyAFsD4qpqsWLurR37Ofta?dl=0\r\nHere is a link to the album via a private Soundcloud channel:\r\nhttps://soundcloud.com/ryanhicks306/sets/pulsing-colours/s-Xh4rU\r\n\r\nAbout Ryan\r\nSinger-songwriter Ryan Hicks makes melodic, cinematic alt-pop music.

314	Bob Chartier, a true late bloomer, has been singing throughout the sixties… his age, not the famous decade.  He found his buried voice at FAMI camp and for the past half dozen years he sings every day, has written over 100 songs and has performed in venues such as the Ness Creek Bluegrass and Old Tyme Festival, the Water Valley Festival.  He was one of the founders of the Music Mile project that saw a music district formed in the heart of Calgary. (musicmile.ca) He hosts the Songwriters in the Round at the Gravity Café on the Music Mile in Inglewood.  He has a number of music accomplices (The Coffee Row Orchestra) who try to make him look good… Bob is a singer songwriter and performs many of his own songs as well as a variety of Roots/Americana type songs.  He is partial to gospel but stops at taking up a collection…\r\n 	["music"]	["americana","country","singer-songwriter"]	no specific demographic but the boomers would love the music	\N	Bob Chartier	587 582 8806	chartierbob1@gmail.com	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1513312247/artist/314/cover_photo.jpg	2017-12-15 04:25:30.117+00	2018-06-08 06:51:28.939+00	available in Calgary and four hour radius...

56	Some of the best things in life are formed from disaster. Such is the case with The Spitzee Post Band, formed in High River Alberta, in the year of the great flood of 2013, when the music was washed away. A bunch of town musicians found that the music was still there. So after drying off the music, the only place left to play was the Sptizee Post bar in town , and what a fitting name for the band "Spitzee" ( native for Higher Ground). With the love of folk, bluegrass, old timey, and killer new grass the "pied pipers" of High River Alberta have been on a quest to put energy and fun in their music, we like to call "Bluesgrass"! From the Calgary Stampede to festivals all over the west, spreading the love of music. Come give us a listen !\n\n\nWayne Corner, an oil field specialist who has played coffee houses, concert venues, mentored by the likes of Tim Williams.  A slide and guitar players' dream.  Family man and ex rancher.\n\nBob Smith, who has influences from The Beatles to Bach with a particular interest in little know bluesmen like Howling Mudbelly. He plays the banjo, baritone uke, and harmonica.\n\nCraig West, a classically trained violinist, with a flair for all kinds of music, never letting his disability slow him down. Playing with numerous bands and a treasure to have him play with the band.\n\nJoe Gore, a lover of music and classics. Who was always singing even when people didn’t want him to! Semi retired oil field worker, husband, father and grandfather with the love of mandolin and guitar.\n\nCoralee Gore, also a lover of music and classics. It's amazing, she never picked up an instrument sooner.  Later in life she met her mentor and now friend Trisha Gagnon from The Jay Birds.  Inspired her to become the upright bass player she is today.  She started in 2011.  She's also a loving wife, mother and grandmother.

284	We’re Jess & Robb, a girl, a guy, & acoustic guitars. We’ve been “dueting” in music and as a couple for roughly two years. 2016/ 2017 has been wild! We celebrated the release of our self-titled debut EP in July at Café Koi. It was awesome to have the songs we’ve written brought to life and shared with the world. Since our EP release, we’ve had the opportunity to travel to Nashville for the CD Baby DIY musician conference and play on the infamous Bluebird Café stage. We’re excited to continue to play around Calgary and meet audiences and musicians that call this city home.\r\n\r\nA little about us; Robb started his musical journey playing bass and fronting raucous punk bands in his formative years. He’s mellowed out since then and prefers picking on his acoustic (but still makes time for a good mosh pit). As a competitive swimmer Jess kept stride with some of the best young athletes across Canada. She found her voice as a musician in her late teens and it wasn’t long before she hung up her suit and made the transition to full-fledged songwriter and performer. That doesn’t mean she’s given up fitness though. She still cruises down the lanes in her spare time and can out-plank anyone.\r\n\r\nEven though we grew up six years apart with different musical inspirations, we both agree our music reflects the pop sensibilities of Taylor Swift, nonchalance of The Ramones, and the wit and heartbreak of Amy Winehouse. We can’t wait to connect and share our music and experiences with you!

The newly released Deafened is a culmination of old and new songs, of utter simplicity and rushes of the mind. These songs would sound good on a mix tape with Regina Spektor, The Counting Crows, Damien Rice and The Frames. Sarah has played the Calgary 4th Street Lilac Festival the last 2 years and has shared stages with the talented likes of Lindsay Ell, Matt Blais, Heather Blush, Kirby Sewell and Trina Nestibo.\nBorn and raised in small-town Alberta, Sarah is a Calgary-based music therapist and singer-songwriter.   Though raised on the piano and classically trained, Sarah was able to find a variety of influences in music in her travels through England and Australia.

699	Sunglaciers’ songs are complex but never fussy, maintaining a healthy display of instrumental dexterity and structural sophistication while never sacrificing their strong songwriting sensibilities and knack for buzzing earworm melodies. It makes sense, then, that they’ve all but devoured the gamut of guitar-based rock music, touching on the textural aspects of key torch-bearers like Sonic Youth and the Velvet Underground, and recalling the choicest elements of groups as diverse & sharp as Deerhunter and the Walkmen. The band released their second EP, Twin Evil Twin, in March 2018.

1706	In 2001, John Wort Hannam quit his teaching job and spent 10 months depleting his savings while sat at his kitchen table, wearing a lucky hat, writing his first ten songs.  Those songs would become his first recording Pocket Full Of Holes, released in 2003. \r\n\r\nEighteen years later, the Alberta musician is working on his eighth full-length recording and has a few feathers in that lucky hat for his first seven offerings.  Feathers that include a JUNO nomination, a Canadian Folk Music Award for Best Album of the Year, A CBC Galaxie Rising Star Award, a Kerrville Texas New Folk win, and numerous Western Canadian Music Award and Canadian Folk Music Award nominations.\r\n\r\nRecent years have seen a great deal of change in John’s life – becoming a Dad, a move to the big city (Lethbridge), a marital reckoning, and overcoming a long, deep bout of depression with episodes of losing his singing voice.  But John has emerged a better songwriter, a better singer, and a better player. John has further found his lyrical style and has landed squarely on his niche in the folk/roots world. He's spent years learning the craft of songwriting and is taking those tools to write some of his most personal songs. He has, quite literally, found his voice. \r\n	["music"]	[]	Folk Music Festival/Soft Seater Audience	\N	John Wort Hannam	4033086082	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1595827496/artist/1706/cover_photo.jpg	2020-07-27 05:21:10.451+00	2020-07-27 05:42:34.748+00	Ongoing Open Availability	[{"name":"Salmon Arm Roots and Blues Festival","date":"2019/08"},{"name":"The Banff Centre - Supporting Blue Rodeo","date":"2019/07"},{"name":"Sundre Arts Centre","date":"2019/11"}]	[{"index":0,"publicId":"artist/1706/hi-res/0.jpg","version":1595827547},{"index":1,"publicId":"artist/1706/hi-res/1.jpg","version":1595827636},{"index":2,"publicId":"artist/1706/hi-res/2.jpg","version":1595827697}]	[{"mediaType":"embeddedYoutube","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9sCk3L1cBA&t=97s"},{"mediaType":"youtubeChannel","url":"https://www.youtube.com/johnworthannammusic"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/johnworthannam"},{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/johnworthannam"},{"mediaType":"twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/johnworthannam"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"https://www.johnworthannam.com"},{"mediaType":"spotify","url":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/4CznJKEwFaOplRHc9tRRBb"},{"mediaType":"appleMusic","url":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/john-wort-hannam/208137163"},{"mediaType":"soundCloud","url":"https://soundcloud.com/john-wort-hannam"},{"mediaType":"bandcampArtist","url":"https://johnworthannam.bandcamp.com/"},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://johnworthannam.bandcamp.com/track/old-flame-new-regret","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"3363863732"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://johnworthannam.bandcamp.com/track/quiet-life","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"1412939643"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://johnworthannam.bandcamp.com/track/love-lives-on","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"675315035"}}]	Juno-nominated Southern Alberta, lyrically driven Roots music.	roots	["folk","singer-songwriter"]	originals	\N	p9sCk3L1cBA	\N	\N	\N

"Songwriting is extremely vulnerable and revealing. It's somewhat of a musical diary," she says.  "Every song has a story behind it, as if to say 'Here is what I have felt, lived through, learned from, and what I have celebrated'.  When I am ready to share that memory with my fans it is an incredibly special moment."\r\nRhonda Louise shares her music within church services, coffee houses, bistros, house concerts, and in her concerts, tailoring her song choices to each unique group of guests.  "I love meeting everyone at my shows and enjoy hearing their stories, how they related to a song or a lyric."\r\n \r\nAs Rhonda Louise has grown as an artist, her songwriting continues to evolve and sometimes surprise her audience, and she looks forward to sharing those moments.  She also welcomes letters and emails, and appreciates knowing how her fans have related to her music.

769	Chastity is a world of its own from the mind of Brandon Williams. Reflecting the working class background of Whitby Ontario, Chastity’s songs are charged with the ethos of archetypal youth on the fringe.\r\n\r\nIt was clear from the release of Chastity’s first demos that this was not “another punk band that can operate at only one speed.” Always concerned with the trending lack of accessibility and inclusivity in public spaces for the arts, the first Chastity show was held in Williams’ own bedroom where, packed wall-to-wall, the police were quickly called. But after the project’s second show supporting DC punk band Priests, Chastity was off to the races, sharing stages with the likes of Metz, Chelsea Wolfe and Fucked Up. All without a full length recording out.\r\n\r\nReleased summer 2018 with Brooklyn Label Captured Tracks, 'Death Lust' follows the plot of suffering to survival. The album begins on a tortured note with ‘Come’ and builds toward the plummeting finale of ‘Chains’, evolving from start to finish in a crescendo of severity. Pitchfork calls Chastity's music 'the Smashing Pumpkins if they’d signed to Dischord'.

The duo blends gripping vocals, beautiful and intense harmonies and a number of instruments including guitar, ukulele, banjo, bass and harmonica.\r\nTheir original material ranges from soulful and heartfelt to fun and light. Through authenticity and shared experiences the duo forms a connection with their audiences and their shows have been described as follows:\r\n“Jaime and Sue are both brimming over with talent. They have a great rapport on stage and they invite the audience to share in the good time they’re having.”\r\nIn October 2017 the duo released their debut album "Fly". Their songs are as colourful and bright as their namesake, deftly exploring universal themes like love, the passage of time, and the beauty—and trials—of life.\r\nBirch’s and Denton’s distinct songwriting and singing styles blend together as smoothly as coffee and chocolate, with a sound reminiscent of Dala and Indigo Girls.

814	Calgary based Denimachine is comprised of Trenton Bullard, Kevin Ross, Brady Side, Satan, and Scotty Charles. This incendiary stoner-rock takes influence from weed, denim, and the mo-town stylings of the Four Tops. Born in Vanuary of 2015, these lucky boys got their start playing covers at a fundraiser for "Alberta's Woodstock" Vantopia. Garnering massive attention from stoners and babysitters alike, Denimachine went on to play Vantopia that year, with all new original material leaving the world of cover gigs in the past. Since that fateful June weekend piss-up, Denimachine has had the opportunity to share the stage with bands such as Red Fang, Black Pussy, Sandrider and Sarah Mclachlan. After completing a staggering 5 date world tour this past summer, the band is now currently working in the studio with Scott Giffin on their first release which will drop sometime between now and the apocalypse. \r\n	["music"]	[]		\N	Scotty Charles	4036804131	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1537912428/artist/814/cover_photo.jpg	2018-09-25 21:49:06.493+00	2018-09-25 22:00:46.423+00	\N	[]	[{"index":0,"publicId":"artist/814/hi-res/0.jpg","version":1537912487},{"index":1,"publicId":"artist/814/hi-res/1.jpg","version":1537912723},{"index":2,"publicId":"artist/814/hi-res/2.jpg","version":1537912768}]	[{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/denimachine/"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/denimachine/"},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://denimachine.bandcamp.com/track/mountains","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"967719408"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://denimachine.bandcamp.com/track/tornado","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"4135687204"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://denimachine.bandcamp.com/track/something-wicked-comes-this-way","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"3085981147"}}]	"Denimachine is the red-headed step child of Satan himself!" - Denimachine. 	rock	["blues","metal"]	originals	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

521	Diemm plays folk harp and sings.  She plays for that one note, that one resonant chord that opens a cascade of ‘yes’ inside you. Her harp strings weave dense landscapes of rhythm and melody. Her voice is a bell, ringing you home. \r\nDiemm’s debut album ‘Ten Thousand Miracles’ launched September 2018. This album is a tapestry of harp, double bass, and percussion, with the kind of vocal harmonies that give chills - and some genre-bending spoken word poetry, too. Her genre is Chamber Folk. The artist she's most compared to is Joni Mitchell, the poet she's most compared to is Rumi.

In 2020 he's releasing his seventh collection, Tangle of Souls, packaged in a 240-page hardcover book of road stories and ruminations, both personal and political.  All the hard miles notwithstanding, he still believes that songs can change your life, and your life can change the world.\r\n\r\n "He sings his heart and soul, and in doing so lets light flood into your own...

1123	Kasha Anne and Mitchell Smith, the singer/songwriter duo better known as The Orchard, couldn’t have picked a better title for their latest album than The Great Unknown. After making an indelible impression on Canada’s country music scene with their first two records, the Alberta natives instinctively knew heading into their third release that change was imminent.\r\n\r\nBut what would that change entail? New sounds? A new producer? A new approach to writing and recording? All of the above, as it turns out.\r\n\r\nLed by the anthemic first single “Sometimes I Wonder,” The Great Unknown is a cosmic blend of rock, country and pop. It’s a vision the pair had from the beginning of completely ignoring genre definitions and just doing what came naturally. Still, they needed a trusted hand to guide them in the studio, and there was no one better to ask than producer Jim Scott (Tedeschi Trucks Band, Marcus King Band).\r\nThe results reveal The Orchard’s true identity for the first time, a songwriting partnership, and band, able to bring together music fans of all types through their fresh and exciting sound.

433	Eighteen years old, a soft guitar case in his hand, entertainer/songwriter Lou Rye (Lutz Reichert) left West Germany in the ‘60s “with Bob Dylan in my heart” to savour music. He jammed with musicians around the world for seven years and attended all the major rock festivals from Monterey Pop to Woodstock.\r\n\r\nAuthor of over 200 songs, creator of 10 CDs, Lou writes, plays and sings Blues, Latin, Smooth Jazz, World Music, New Age, Folk and much, much more – each with his distinctive touch. Lou and his band, The Lou Rye All Stars, have played, recorded and rubbed shoulders with the best in Detroit, Michigan, Ottawa, Ontario and now Calgary, Alberta.\r\n\r\nSinging in boisterous discipline and laying down licks reminiscent of BB King, Etta James and Carlos Santana, for over fifty years this world-travelling troubadour has brought audiences to their feet. “Music allows me to connect with the world,” explains Lou. “I love adding to the love and light of the planet with my music. It brings joy to people.”	["music"]	["blues","other-music","singer-songwriter"]	\N	\N	Lou Rye	403 454 2280	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1519767160/artist/433/cover_photo.jpg	2018-02-27 21:19:30.116+00	2018-06-08 06:51:28.954+00	\N	\N	\N	[{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/Lou.Rye.1"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/1.bluesman"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"http://www.lourye.com"}]	\N	\N	\N	originals	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

1176	We're a young, fun modern blues band composed of four musicians (2 guitarists/singers, 1 bassist, 1 drummer) with all our own equipment. We're comfortable playing in any space we can fit, which isn't too difficult as a four piece band. Our music has a really diverse appeal, with our music catering both to teenage girls and 40-year-old blues guys simultaneously. Our set is about a 50/50 split of originals and covers at the moment, with deep cuts by the Rolling Stone, Chuck Berry and Fleetwood Mac. More low-key gigs and coffee shops fit our sound, as do fun stages at bars for Fridays/Saturday nights. We have pretty strong social connections with Calgary and can guarantee a certain amount of friends/fans to come to support us independent of the crowds the venue can offer on its own, so booking us draws a couple extra customers!

Rick brings highly trained jazz guitar skills to a variety of styles, singing and playing through (of course!) jazz standards, but also including acoustic originals, covers of folk and classic rock and pop tunes, and new takes on tunes familiar to all. Volume is low to medium, allowing patrons to either listen fully, or continue to visit with friends. Rick has performed frequently at the SaskTel Jazz festival, the Medicine Hat Jazzfest, and innumerable coffee shops, house concerts, and folk venues in between.

1004	Jolena is an up and coming singer/songwriter. She started writing music at the age of 12, after picking up a few guitar lessons. Every week she would leave her lessons with homework to practice and return with a new song written.

You can often find her out at various open mics through the city, or at home writing new material. Some of her recent highlights include a radio appearance on CJSW 90.9 FM, regular appearances at Blind Beggar Pub, Cafe Koi , Food Festivals, Farmer Market and the occasional busking gig.\r\n\r\nJolena is in the process of creating new music with plans of an EP and more shows to come in the future.

1460	Caitlin Connelly is a Rocky Mountain artist rooted in evergreen-fresh folk and small-town splendour. Inspired by canyons, caves, and excruciating break-ups, she uses thoughtfully-woven vocal melodies and careful fingerpicking to honestly channel emotion-filled experiences into mindful art. Connelly is notoriously nomadic and credits motion as one of the most influential and constant anchors in her mercurial and buoyant lifestyle. With a home-base in Banff National Park, the songwriter has also created space for herself in Los Angeles, Santa Cruz, Melbourne, Vancouver, and Bali, which has led to opportunities both career-building and breath-taking, such as performing from sea to shining sea - Vancouver to Halifax - on a passenger train, filming live music videos in Hollywood, and hitch-hiking thousands of kilometres through the outback of Australia and the California coast.

Both trained musicians with 10+ years of experience on and off stage and across a variety of genres.

1434	Edmonton based pianist and organist, Rooster Davis, specializes in the New Orleans traditions of seminal players such as Dr. John, Professor Longhair, Allen Toussaint, and James Booker. His own style is a combination of everything he has learned from these great players, giving him a driving, rhythmic style of playing the blues, and a heavy NOLA second line funk feel. Rooster performs solo piano, solo piano with vocals, duo (usually with saxophone or trombone) with or without vocals, or with his band, which can be anywhere from a trio to a quartet. Rooster travels every year to New Orleans and studies piano there with Tom McDermott, Joshua Paxton, and Joe Krown, and is considered one of the leading experts in this style of piano performance here in Canada.

52	Acclaimed Vancouver artist, Norine Braun releases her 10th album, Gone To The Spirits. The concept album was recorded and mixed with producer Adam Popowitz at Rear Window Song and Sound. The session players include: the Juno nominated Adam Popowitz on bass and lead guitar, Elliot Polsky on drums, Huggybear Leonard on blues harp, Alice Fraser on keys and accordion, Malcolm Aiken on trumpet and flugelhorn with Norine Braun on rhythm guitar, ukulele, Navajo flute and vocals. \n  \nThe concept album is birthed from the Ququnak Paǂkiy Song Collection that Braun wrote from a Canada Council For The Arts Award last year. The songs are based on the engaging and dramatic life story of a Two Spirit, Ktunaxa warrior woman, courier and guide, who lived in the early 19th century. Gone-To-The-Spirits was the gifted oracle and accomplished warrior who appeared in the journals of trappers and explorers and was noted as having transformed gender and also became a chief.\n \nBraun’s irrepressible passion to create music with no imposed boundaries makes this work impossible to categorize. In the beginning, the haunting and ethereal Morning Prayer mesmerizes with ambient ascension toward the heavens. Throughout the album’s rich textures of worldly pop, jazz and blues, the listener is transported among dreamy ice fields, rootsy coyote canyons, thunderous storms toward soulful victory and a sublime rock transformation. One enters a sonic journey in this album that soothes and excites, to another time where Gone To The Spirits story enfolds.

1213	For anyone who has lived in Kitchener, Ontario since the 1980s, it’s a safe bet they know the enigmatic graffiti adorning a prominent railroad bridge that simply states, “Twas Now.”  No one really knows who put it there or what it means, but for the duo of Mike and Diana Erb, they’ve found a message within it that has come to embody their approach to making music.\r\n\r\nIn adopting the name Twas Now, the Erbs felt it encompassed their vision of combining the oldest forms of folk and country music with modern lyrics and attitude. They proved definitively how capable they are at mining the past with their 2018 Canadian Folk Music Award-nominated debut album Old Fashioned Way, which featured songs by the Carter Family, the Louvin Brothers, Hank Williams and others. Now with Flesh & Bone, the pair put their own songwriting talents on display while musically adhering to roots traditions.\r\n\r\nTeaming again with producer John “Beetle” Bailey, whose resume includes work with Serena Ryder, Alex Cuba and Molly Johnson, the Erbs laid down the 11 songs on Flesh & Bone in the relaxed atmosphere of their family cottage, beginning with just their voices and acoustic guitars. Mike began the overdubbing process afterward, which was finished through the help of renowned local players such as fiddler Shane Guse, upright bassist Mark McIntyre, and pedal steel guitarist Steve Wood. In many ways, the Erbs believe Flesh & Bone is the culmination of everything about music they’ve learned on their own to this point, and also the first step on the path toward an entirely new level of creativity.\r\n\r\n“We started off by playing traditional folk and country tunes that had two-part harmony carrying most of the song,” Mike says. “Our original music has grown from there, but we still draw from artists like the Carter Family. In fact, we couldn’t help including one of their songs on this record [‘Poor Orphan Child’]. Mother Maybelle’s guitar technique remains the foundation on which we base a lot of our writing.”\r\n\r\nDiana adds, “At the same time, we’ve both been inspired a lot recently by Margo Price and Brandi Carlile. Their albums sound amazing, both from a performance and production standpoint, but more importantly they are artists with fierce determination to show the world that women do belong at the top of the music chain.”\r\n\r\nThat non-traditional spirit boldly shines through on several tracks on Flesh & Bone, particularly “Black Coffee,” written in the wake of personal experiences with the generally taboo subjects of infertility and miscarriage. Another is “Part Of Me,” inspired by friends’ courage to come out, and in the process change the structure of their families through choosing truth and love.\r\n\r\nHowever, they don’t shy away from revealing their sense of humour, most evident on “Confessin’ Profession Blues,” a swinging tune that tackles the age-old dilemma of whether or not the grass is truly greener on the other side of the fence. At this point for the Erbs, it’s hard to tell which side of the fence they’re on, since music is the central focus of their lives more than ever. On top of Twas Now, they operate a successful music school and maintain long associations with others in the K-W music community. Although Mike was doing other things for a time, including serving as bandleader for Dawn Langstroth, and playing around New York City’s Lower East Side with the likes of Hugh Christopher Brown, Richard Julian and Tony Scherr, he never felt the urge to abandon his family’s strong ties to Waterloo Region.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, along with working on music, Diana was and continues to be an accomplished visual artist whose work has been extensively exhibited. She now creates work strictly on commission, given how focused the pair now are on music. “As we keep writing together, the process gets more and more exciting,” she says. “For a lot of the songs on the album, we would take the spark of a lyrical or melodic idea, grab a guitar and start bouncing ideas off each other. Once the ball got rolling, things seemed to come very quickly.”\r\n\r\nMike explains, “We pride ourselves in being perfectionists, meaning we will workshop something until we have exactly what we want to say on the page. It’s a constant cycle of evaluation and editing until a song is ready to record, and in that sense we’re really proud of how all of these songs turned out.”\r\n\r\nTwas Now—we can all thank whatever mysterious hand painted those words on that bridge for helping to give us one of the best new duos on the Canadian folk music scene. Although the album is called Flesh & Bone, it’s sure to capture a lot of hearts and minds.

127	With its skillful blend of infectious folk-pop and incisive lyrics, Nancy Laberge’s new album When We Were Friends firmly establishes an important new voice in Canadian music. Many Albertans are already familiar with the Calgary-based singer/songwriter through her past efforts, as well as through being a fixture on the provincial scene. But with this second solo outing, Laberge has made a dramatic leap forward both in her own songwriting style and production approach, leaving little doubt that she’s ready for the national stage. Coming off her previous album, Write From The Heart, Laberge’s extensive journey in creating When We Were Friends began with the spark of the heart-wrenching title track, a glimpse into her past experiences. As more material accumulated, Laberge teamed up with JUNO and CCMA-award winning producer Mike Little who gathered a top-flight group of musicians to complement the wide range of emotions embedded in each song. The results range from the instantly ear-catching opener “Meant For You & Me,” to the driving twang of “For Loving Me,” and the stomping and witty “Next Big Thing.” The overall range Laberge displays throughout When We Were Friends suggests that she could fall into any number of current roots music categories, although in the end it contains only one sound, her own.

This husband and wife, internationally-touring duo travel in their 1976 Winnebago.\n\nFrom the beginning... \nAs the fall of 2012 approached, inspiration for change struck and a decision was made to bet the farm and take a chance on a life less ordinary. The house was sold, jobs were left behind and an old towable trailer became the new way of life. Packing up only the essentials - their two dogs, guitars, amplifiers and their two favorite coffee mugs, the duo hit the road and travelled over 7000kms in three months throughout the southern United States, in-search of musical inspiration.\n\nAfter returning to Ontario in the late spring of 2013, the duo took to the studio and in a weekend recorded their self-titled debut album. Featuring a collection of songs inspired by their recent journey, it would become the foundation for a new direction. \n\nIn January 2016 the duo embarked on a nine-month tour, travelling over 20,000 miles and playing more than 80 shows in 13 States and three Provinces.

97	Jeremy Gignoux grew up in France, where he learned classical violin and piano, while getting his first exposure to playing jazz, rock, Irish traditional music, organic improvisation and composition. After moving to Canada in 2011, first to Calgary then to Montreal, he solidified his inclination towards jazz but also started playing bluegrass/country, traditional North American and Eastern European music. He studied composition at the Université de Montréal.\nDrawn in by all these inspirations and learning, he has developed an original sound and technique, and loves to experiment beyond just music into the realms of dance, comedy and movement. His compositions and arrangements mix folklore and improvisation to bring the listener on an acoustic journey.\nNow back in Calgary, he is active in the jazz and traditional scenes. In 2016 and 2017, he was part of two Decidedly Jazz Danceworks productions with William Parker and Nick Fraser.\nHis past projects include the UofC Jazz Band, Locomotive Ghost, Les Poissons Voyageurs, and Lindex.

Taking cues from artists My Morning Jacket, Patty Griffin, Neil Young and Kathleen Edwards, Wilson’s music strikes a balance between engaging lyrics and driving guitar builds, reflecting overall a contemporary sensibility.

115	Orit Shimoni, formerly also known as Little Birdie, is “one of the nation’s most alluring vocalists,” {The Calgary Herald} and “one of the most lyrically impactful vocalists” {Beatroute Magazine}.   Previously a teacher and academic, Israeli/Canadian Orit (pronounced O’reet) became a full-time touring solo artist after releasing two, highly acclaimed albums in Montreal.    She moved to Berlin to write and record her third album, and after that decided to live out of a suitcase so she could pursue touring and recording with her entire focus.   She has been officially ‘on the road’ for nearly eight years, no fixed address.\nDue to release a seventh album, Orit’s songs and performances draw diverse audiences into her profound and universal themes and her storytelling talent, with writing compared to that of Leonard Cohen, and a voice that has been compared to Bonnie Raitt, Norah Jones, and KD Lang.  But Orit is a truly unique and prolific artist. In a sea of predictable writing and ‘pretty’ voices. She stands out as a special force with important relatable messages, and a sincere smile.\nAll of her albums have achieved international radio play and highly favourable press, and have each charted on Canadian college radio.   Three more have been started for future release. \nA special voice in a turbulent time, Orit Shimoni’s music is not to be missed.

125	Joanna Drummond is a folk singer-songwriter from Calgary with a clear, compelling soprano voice, and beautifully written, thoughtful lyrics. Her songs can feel like old folk songs written in a different world, and yet also speak vividly about the times that we are living in.\n \nThough Joanna began in classical music, with a B.A. In Music from the University of Calgary and a background in operatic training, she has chosen to leave opera entirely behind and turn her instrument towards folk music. She is drawn towards folk music because of its intimacy and simplicity, the way that often just one instrument and one voice can be enough, the power of words working together with melody. She counts Joni Mitchell, Paul Simon, Ani DiFranco and Amelia Curran among her main influences.

After the release of his debut album, “It’s War” in 2013, Cuss has been touring throughout Western Canada and has had the privilege to attend two artist residencies at Banff Centre where his exposure to talented musicians from various genres have helped Cuss hone his craft. Upon completion of his first residency, Cuss headed south to Nashville Tennessee to record his second album, “Night Thief”, which quickly garnered attention in the roots/blue scene.\n\nCuss’ personal influences are those who have overcome diversity, he sees deep beauty in human strength, grit, and determination. His musical influences include the likes of Jason Isbell, Townes Van Zandt, and Steve Earle; the dark, honesty in his music reflects these influences.

240	Like three hearts beating in perfect time, the music of CASATI is a living thing, constantly changing, evolving and reinventing itself. Grace Hrabi, Jesse Popeski & Quintin Bart search for stories waiting to be told and collaborate in bringing them to life. Songs about love found or lost, cautionary tales of time slipping away or even a whimsical tune about bicycle rides.\r\n\r\nCASATI focuses on making every piece a collaboration between all three artists. It is extremely important to the trio that each arrangement represents all three artistic voices and therefore some arrangements can take months to develop.  The culmination of these pieces is captured on CASATI’s debut album, “There Will Be Days,”  released April 2017.\r\n\r\nGrace Hrabi - Vocals/Ukulele\r\nJesse Popeski - Guitar/Vocals\r\nQuintin Bart - Bass/Vocals/Hurdy-Gurdy	["music"]	["folk","jazz","singer-songwriter"]		\N	Grace Hrabi	2049988699	casatiband@gmail.com	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1505324187/artist/240/cover_photo.jpg	2017-09-13 17:29:26.837+00	2018-06-08 06:51:28.921+00	\N	[{"name":"Winnipeg Jazz Festival","date":"2017/06"},{"name":"Rainbow Trout Music Festival","date":"2017/08"},{"name":"The Winnipeg Fringe Festival","date":"2017/07"}]	\N	[{"mediaType":"website","url":"http://www.casatiband.com"}]	\N	\N	\N	originals	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
805	Cope is a two-piece noise rock band from Lethbridge, Alberta, consisting of Mickey Hayward on drums and Tyson Wiebe on guitars and vocals. Taking cues from post-rock bands such as Mogwai and Explosions in the Sky, as well as from heavy duos like Local H and Death From Above; Cope is about duality - quiet and loud, light and shadow, serenity and rage, laughter and sorrow. \r\nDebuting in Spring 2015, Cope has received buzz across Canada, Europe and South America on the strength of their chaotic live shows and their self-titled debut EP (Cope, 2017). This has led to media coverage in publications including Air Canada’s Enroute Magazine (July 2017), Beatroute, New Noise Magazine and Metal Underground.\r\nTheir second EP, the aptly named “Second” has been released on cassette and digitally May 4th, 2018. Second, helmed by Producer/Engineer Clayton Smith and Mastering Engineer Jon Martin of Green Recording Company, has added a layer of sonic shellac over Cope’s bellicose sound. The result is an EP that expands on the Cope formula, but with laser focus and a polished sheen. \r\nCope will be touring Second through B.C., Alberta and Saskatchewan this October and November of 2018. Live, Cope adds another dimension to their music; sometimes eschewing formal song structure for squalls of feedback or throwing a song on the setlist that they are learning in front of the audience. Cope aren’t afraid to let the night turn their songs into something weird and new during their performance.

770	At a time when bands are stripping to the bare essentials, shedding instruments and members in favour of pre-recorded tracks, Yes We Mystic remains committed, in all senses, to excess. Their maximalist live show packs stages with equipment; their rich, knotted orchestration seem to indulge their every instrumental whim; and their album releases resemble large scale performance art projects. The trick, if it is to be defined, is to set an expectation, and then defy it; the band takes ideas and sounds from all over the musical spectrum and filters them into something that is exhilarating, heartrending, pummelling, and grand. Perhaps elsewhere the anthemic has had it’s day; here, however, it is bent and distorted beyond recognition into something–dare we say–fresh.\r\n\r\nPraised as “art pop transformers” (BeatRoute), and charged with a “fearless creative energy” (Exclaim!), Yes We Mystic has in recent years become a steadily growing force on the Canadian indie scene. If you had to put a finger on it, perhaps the best descriptor for the band’s sound is “intense, cinematic art pop”. The band matured into this sound with the release of their 2016 debut album Forgiver, recorded with legendary Canadian producer Jace Lasek (Patrick Watson, Wolf Parade, Land Of Talk). The album was met with acclaim in both Germany (where the album was released on DanCan records) and Canada. To support Forgiver, they played over 100 shows in 10 countries, appearing at NXNE, SXSW, The Great Escape, Reeperbahn, and Orange Blossom Special (itself a career highlight).

1726	K A R Í M A H is a proud black femme; genre-bending singer/songwriter of Soul, R&B and alternative pop. K A R Í M A H’s latest material is inspired by her favourite sayings: "Reveal to heal", and "you've got to go through hell to get out of it". With a penchant for going against the grain with her tongue pressed firmly to her cheek, it's no surprise that her upcoming debut EP is entitled "THIS IS THE END".  K A R Í M A H's tackles topics of feminism, questioning gender roles, growing up, emotional abuse and suicide, all with the lens of a survivor. Singing in both English and French, K A R Í M A H embraces both the doom and gloom and beauty of life in her catchy yet unique songs. \r\n K A R Í M A H's music is a cathartic journey—soulful and dark, full of fury and hope. \r\nFor fans of : Lizzo, Beyoncé, Solange, Adele, Alabama Shakes\r\n\r\nFeatured on: La Voix (The Voice Canada) Season 5 (2017) - Montreal, QC\r\nWinner/Gagnant: Polyfonik (gala de la chanson d'Alberta) (2014)- Edmonton, AB\r\nWinner/Gagnant: Chant'Ouest (gala de la chanson de l'Ouest Canadien) (2014) Edmonton, AB\r\nWinner: Memphis Bound Blues Challenge (2014) (with Robert Walsh in the original Blues duo Two Blue) Edmonton, AB\r\nSemi-Finalist: International Blues Challenge (2015) - Memphis, TN, USA\r\n	["music"]	[]	25+	\N	Karimah Marshall	780-884-6014	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1600114359/artist/1726/cover_photo.jpg	2020-08-22 23:05:39.999+00	2020-09-14 20:12:40.956+00	\N	[{"name":"Block Heater festival (National Music Centre Skybridge, Calgary, AB)","date":"2020/02"},{"name":"Alberta Spotlight (National Music Centre Performance Hall, Calgary, AB)","date":"2019/02"},{"name":"Grey Cup Festival (Alberta House Stage, Edmonton, AB)","date":"2018/11"}]	[{"index":0,"publicId":"artist/1726/hi-res/0.jpg","version":1600113997}]	[{"mediaType":"embeddedYoutube","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3duxMyK_d0w"},{"mediaType":"youtubeChannel","url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClLw5-Ukr-VK0L-jQAQ087w"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/karimahmusik"},{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/karimahmusik"},{"mediaType":"twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/karimahmusik"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"http://www.karimah.ca"},{"mediaType":"spotify","url":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/3p3Fa0i8nyY6KzT3q4JstQ"},{"mediaType":"bandcampArtist","url":"https://karimah.bandcamp.com/releases"},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://karimah.bandcamp.com/track/teenage-rebellion","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"2405503599"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://karimah.bandcamp.com/track/grim-reaper","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"1575724753"}}]	Confronting your demons never sounded so beautiful.

737	A folk-punk tour-de-force, their subversion of Eastern-European musical traditions, enigmatic imagery and raucous live shows are pushing Zrada to craft some of the most forward-thinking and captivating world music in Canada today. With its base in Winnipeg, Zrada has been experimenting with the soundscapes of their ancestral Ukraine for over a decade. Striking vocal harmonies, powerful trumpet and violin melodies combine with jazz infused rhythms to create a wild and joyous dance floor experience.\r\n\r\nZrada’s sound originates equal parts in the fog-shrouded valleys of the Carpathians and the sweaty mosh-pits of Anthrax shows; however their music is mysterious and primal in a unique way. Their songs have the ability to transcend language and act as a siren call for those ready to let loose and pick up on the band’s frenetic energy. While Zrada’s music strives to defy the conventional tropes of Ukrainian music from the diaspora, they remain proud of their musical and linguistic heritage. Their 2016 album “Legend” contains a kaleidoscope of folk sounds and styles all the while paying homage to contemporary influences like Gogol Bordello, The Clash and Ukraine’s Haydamaky. Each Zrada song leads the listener farther into a folk-punk universe of melancholy, madness and mystery.\r\n\r\n“Surf-style guitar, Jew’s Harp and an almost pornographic bass groove.” – Uptown Magazine\r\n\r\n“Zrada’s album is 16 tracks of harmonious majesty, intricately crafted with raucous rock attitude.” – Stylus Magazine\r\n\r\n“Balkan and Slavic melodies fused with old-school punk rock energy and set to a raging boil.” – Winnipeg Free Press\r\n\r\nIn 2005, six musicians who loved equally Ukrainian folk music and all things metal, came together to create a unique sonic tableau. Trumpet, accordion and violin led the songs while guitars and booming drums propelled the music forward, often times at break-neck speed. With a variety of lineup changes over the years Zrada has continued to incorporate new styles, such as jazz and Afro-beat into their repertoire. Zrada has become a mainstay in Winnipeg’s diverse music scene and has also performed on a variety of Canadian and American stages. Recent performances include headlining at the Festival du Voyageur, Big Fun Music Festival and a performance at the West End Cultural Centre with Western Canadian Music Award winners The Mariachi Ghost. Zrada is currently recording new music at Collector Studio with plans to digitally release songs steadily throughout the year. Zrada is Andrijko Semaniuk, Adam Ciric, Alex Derlago, Mikhas Chabluk, Nick Luchak and Andriy Michalchyshyn.

Blending sounds inspired by the 90s/early 2000s R&B with modern pop melodies and slick rap flows, Teekay Othello debuted in 2021 with a bang.\r\n\r\nIn April of 2021, he released his debut EP "Luv Letters", a 7-song R&B project based on various events in his love life. To follow up, he then released his summer-themed project "Have Fun: The Collection" in July of the same year. This 8-song project includes sounds inspired by a spectrum of genres curated for uplifting and nostalgic feelings for the listeners.\r\n\r\nIn 2022, Teekay Othello released a flurry of singles. To start the year fresh, in January he dropped "Signs", a starry, romantic and astrology-themed R&B tune featuring close friend and fellow artist A.Patrice. In February, he then dropped "Addicted", a passionate breakup anthem with hard-hitting and club-like sounding 808s, and a dreamy harp riff. During the summer months, he dropped "Happy Life", an alternative-sounding Hip-Hop collaboration with the founder of Kulinary Records, The Chef2k, then "Body", a bright-sounding nightclub collaboration with TikTok sensation TheRealVanesse, and "Lights Down", a smooth R&B/Afrobeats crossover track with fellow artist Solomon DaGreat.\r\n\r\nTeekay Othello also curates popular Spotify playlists during his free time. His most popular playlist "2am drive" with over 3400 followers sets the tone for a laid-back and relaxed night, with songs that range in several R&B and Hip-Hop subgenres. He utilizes his playlists to help bring more listeners and streams for independent artists, including himself.\r\n\r\nFans of Teekay Othello can expect to be swept away in sweet melodies this upcoming Fall. After maintaining over 5000 monthly listeners for the year and accumulating nearly half a million streams across all platforms, Teekay Othello is currently preparing the release of the sequel project "Luv Letters 2".\r\n\r\nTop 10 Trending Songs on Spotify:\r\nAddicted\r\nBody\r\nSigns\r\nLie2me\r\nWorth It\r\nShe Don't\r\nTwisted\r\nSorry\r\nTake Your Time\r\nHave Fun	["music"]	[]	Young Adults, University Students, ages 18-34	\N	Teekay Othello	5877037563	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1660765468/artist/1449/cover_photo.jpg	2020-01-17 16:39:44.418+00	2022-08-24 20:21:46.967+00	Anytime in Calgary	[{"name":"Telus Spark Science Centre","date":"2022/06"},{"name":"The Dark Arts Restaurant & Drink","date":"2022/03"},{"name":"The Rec Room","date":"2020/02"}]	[{"index":0,"publicId":"artist/1449/hi-res/0.png","version":1661372428},{"index":1,"publicId":"artist/1449/hi-res/1.png","version":1661372492},{"index":2,"publicId":"artist/1449/hi-res/2.png","version":1661372504}]	[{"mediaType":"embeddedYoutube","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ov31FHpVVu4"},{"mediaType":"twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/teekayothello"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/teekayothellomusic"},{"mediaType":"youtubeChannel","url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqsTF5ChmTtS9JrnCzOX4Q"},{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/teekayothello"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"https://linktr.ee/teekaytko"},{"mediaType":"spotify","url":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/2VbH2IH39mJmn0qkJtqITd?si=tDwJDl0zSKKMQb0QGYnDyw"},{"mediaType":"appleMusic","url":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/teekay-othello/1495016568"},{"mediaType":"soundCloud","url":"https://soundcloud.com/itsalwayssunnyyyc"},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://teekayothello.bandcamp.com/track/twisted-feat-fatuma","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"296356818"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://teekayothello.bandcamp.com/track/worth-it","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"4162048868"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://teekayothello.bandcamp.com/track/she-dont-feat-jon-swan","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"3911446644"}}]	Teekay Othello is a 24-year-old recording artist based in Calgary, Alberta.

Individually and collectively having played thousands of shows locally and abroad, the McDades continue to shine a spotlight on original music from Edmonton and Alberta.

304	JORY KINJO: Artist Bio\r\n\r\nA love for all roots music has taken Jory Kinjo around the world in the last 20 years of his musical career. He has performed on bills with a range of artists from Ziggy Marley to ZZ Top.  Kinjo was raised in R&B, Blues & Soul music, but his career has since touched on Jazz, Reggae, Ska and even Country music. \r\n\r\nKinjo joined Calgary soul band Mocking Shadows in 1999 and still plays with the band to this day. With the Shadows, Kinjo has performed on multiple tours with B.B. King, shows with Buddy Guy, ZZ Top and dozens of other legendary artists. \r\n\r\nIn 2008 Kinjo was asked to play bass on a European tour with Montreal’s third wave ska band, the Planet Smashers. The Smashers were performing at various punk/ska venues with a highlight performance with Bad Religion at Belgium’s Groezrock Festival.  This experience sparked a new love for Ska & Reggae music.\r\n\r\nFollowing his newfound inspiration, Kinjo began a solo career and took his music in a new direction in 2009.  His venture into the Ska/Reggae world has resulted in shows and tours with such bands as Fishbone, UB40, the English Beat and the Wailers. \r\n\r\nIn 2010, Jory began performing in Japan with his younger brother, Kaley Kinjo. The Kinjo Brothers perform in both Japanese and English and still tour Japan yearly at various festivals and venues. \r\n\r\nFrom 2014 - 2017, Kinjo moved to New York City part time and worked with such Ska/Rocksteady bands as the Slackers and the Rocksteady 7.  Kinjo performed and recorded in NYC, often forced to write and practice in the subway in the late hours to escape the noise restrictions of his East Village apartment. \r\n\r\nKinjo’s solo show is a varied and sincere one.

Unlike many electronic music projects, this project incorporates an ever-shifting panorama keeping repetition as a mere stepping stone from one section to the other. The project consists of little to no recognizable melodies or harmonies, instead incorporating sharp and disorienting percussion. Rhythmic instability and amorphous sound objects are two main concepts found in State n Division, as well as a pointillistic approach that counterstrikes the dull comfort of sustain and replaces it with a frenetic call for attention.

1535	Lucette is the moniker of Canadian artist Lauren Gillis, a soulful and emotive singer self-describing her music as “country infused dream-pop”. Her two albums vary from dark folk and southern gothic tales to what Rolling Stone describes as “a bold expansion of Lucette’s melodic sensibilities...that avoid the rootsy clichés of Americana music.” Deluxe Hotel Room delivers introspective songwriting, piano ballads, and powerful saxophone solos. Lucette’s writing has evolved from telling stories to a genuine self-expression of emotions and existential exploration layered with her emotive, velvet voice.\r\n\r\n“Whether writing from a lonely place or full of love, I want to authentically connect with people through my music.”\r\n\r\nLucette’s first album, Black is the Color, was produced by Dave Cobb and led to her opening for Sturgill Simpson on his Metamodern Sounds of Country Music tour. Her second album, Deluxe Hotel Room, was produced by Simpson, whose no-nonsense instruction to her was, “Sing it like you mean it.” The two connected with the intent of making art, timeless yet fresh. \r\n\r\nLucette has been touring since 2012 through the United States, Canada, and the UK with artists such as Joe Ely, David Ramirez, The Secret Sisters, and Netflix documentary star Rodriguez. Following the release of Deluxe Hotel Room she performed her own headlining tour in June 2019. Lucette draws influence from Leonard Cohen, Emmylou Harris, Tom Waits, and Elton John in her life-long pursuit of creating art.

His “visceral songs poke and prod at the great mysteries; mortality, death, life, love, guilt and loneliness, all figuring into his compelling vision.” Xpress/Ottawa.\r\n\r\nLife for Jack began on the high prairies of Alberta, playing at a young age in barn halls, tourist trains, bar rooms, coffeehouses, festivals, campgrounds, missionary outposts and even at the carnival a few times. Jack is a musician with a desire to be a vehicle of change for western consciousness evident in his political and social lyrical commentary. His songs are a reflection of his personal lost hope and decayed dreams countered by a hopeful rising from the darkness with perseverance for brighter tomorrows. They have been recorded by the CBC and Nettwerk Records, and used by Warner Brothers in TV shows as well as in various productions for film soundtracks. He has released four albums; The Hymns of Sorrow (1994),  Scintilla (2000), Carnival of Mystery (2002), and most recent 2018 release of Lost and Returning (a compilation of collected songs 2005-2015).

217	Lisa Anderson’s silly, fierce, perky, and passionate indie-pop reflects the struggles and joys of embracing all life has to offer – the dark, the blissful, and the grey in between. Her pragmatic optimism and quirky humour weave through her lyrics to form moments of kinship with her listeners. In performance, Lisa accompanies her vocals with a keyboard, ukulele, and looper pedal, creating unique soundscapes that match her distinct view of the world.  \r\n\r\nAnderson has captivated audiences around the world with her “beautiful and powerful voice,” as described by Pablo Garcinuño of Spain’s Los 4 Palos Blog. Her self-titled debut album was sponsored and promoted by Spain’s nation-wide radio network Los 40 Principales. She has performed in Spain, France, Italy, Ireland, the Czech Republic, and Canada.  \r\n\r\nSince returning to Calgary in 2015, Lisa was a top ten finalist in the 2018 Canadian Songwriting Competition, performed at the 2018  Big Winter Classic Music Festival, and was awarded an honorable mention at the 2015 Calgary Folk Festival songwriting competition.

1524	Familiar places, familiar names - familiar to some?\r\n\r\nJon Capus is the quintessential prairie boy born and raised in Edmonton, Alberta. As a solo performer, Jon’s material takes on folky, singer-songwriter qualities. The full band arrangements on his recordings blend folk, rock, blues, and pop together.\r\n\r\nHe has spent the last decade of his music career honing his craft in various bands and side projects. The Familiar, out January 7th, 2022, is his long anticipated debut album.\r\n\r\nThe Familiar deals with themes of love, depression, relationships, and change. “Hums” asks if you’ll sing along, while “Backburner” demands that you do. The opening notes of “Viktoria” feel familiar yet new. “Hello, It’s Me (Again)” wonders if any of us will ever get out of our unconscious loops. Is there comfort in familiarity or is that exactly what holds us back?\r\n\r\nAs a multi-instrumentalist, Jon plays almost all the instruments found on The Familiar. Some friends and loved ones helped fill in the blanks on drums and vocals where needed.\r\n\r\nJon has opened for the likes of Benjamin Francis Leftwich, Matt Epp, and The Sumner Brothers. He currently resides in his hometown of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.

1840	Born and raised in forest hills, Michigan. Among the bible thumpers of the Midwest peninsula is where this origin story began but the plot thickens as the story goes on. With twists and turns, red herrings, and false heroes paving the way to the present moment. \r\nGot started at the Sunday night funnies in grand rapids and have been addicted to performing ever since. I've done well over 500 open mics all over Michigan and a few out of state as well. Laff tracks in Troy, MI; comic con in Traverse City, MI; hollywood hotel, LA. I enjoy provoking thought and wonder in people. Shaking them awake, so to speak.\r\nAnother skill in my bag of tricks is a unique form of poi (flow art). I spin fire poi nunchaku or fire nunchucks.

252	Canadian jazz vocalist Deanne Matley’s reputation just keeps growing. Known for her pure but powerful voice, her way with a vocal line, and her ability to swing hard, emote softly, and connect with her audience, Deanne has made a name for herself across Canada and beyond. Her five albums, with songs ranging from standards to pop Christmas favourites, have earned her spots in top jazz playlists in Canada, the United States and Europe, and in the hearts of listeners around the world.\r\n\r\nDeanne is a flexible performer in both English and French, who’s as comfortable in front of a big band on a festival stage as she is singing with a trio in an intimate club space. She’s wowed audiences at jazz festivals and clubs in Canada, France, and as far away as Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. Deanne has shared the stage with jazz greats including Larry Koonse, Bryan Lynch, Matt Catingub, Tommy Banks and Al Kay. She’s featured in the September 2018 edition of Downbeat, and was a 2018 nominee as the “Industry Person of the Year” for the YYC Music Awards in her hometown of Calgary.\r\n\r\nA singer since childhood, Deanne studied at the Berklee College of Music, the Banff Centre for the Arts, and the Stanford Jazz Institute both before and after launching her career as a jazz vocalist. She performs a jazz-focused but eclectic repertoire with combos of all sizes, including her own Deanne Matley Trio, in Montreal, Calgary, and Europe.\r\n\r\nDeanne’s latest and most ambitious album, Because I Loved, an emotion-driven combination of original songs and exquisite, heartfelt jazz and pop covers, came out in May 2018. Distributed by Distribution Select, the album features well-known Montreal artists Ranee Lee (vocals), Jim Doxas (drums), Paul Shrofel (piano) and Adrian Vedady (bass), joining Deanne in an artistic tour-de-force.

1749	Marked by a fierce wanderlust and a collection of Canadian addresses that spans the entire country, John Guliak’s calm and worldly vision expressed through his eclectic songwriting is both magnetic and effortless. His understated turns of phrase convey a considered approach to life and its delicacies while at the same time maintaining a melodic and accessible appeal. With more than 30 years as a prairie troubadour, touring internationally and living abroad, Guliak’s best and brightest may still be just ahead.\r\n\r\nWith a profound respect for literature and a thirst for knowledge, Guliak’s passion for both mainstream and alternative music grew as he ventured from the farmlands of Saskatchewan to the capitals of Europe. As a result of his studies in Political Economy, he became tethered to socially conscious folk music for most of his young adulthood. Over time Guliak gradually rediscovered traditional arrangements and writing styles that had passed him by in earlier years and began generating his own variations on these timeless blueprints. The songs that result from this perspective have been compared to those of other uniquely Canadian voices such as Gordon Lightfoot and Leonard Cohen. \r\n\r\nAs a veteran artist of Mint Records, Guliak released two full-length albums that were met with critical acclaim. In 2016, he self-released Fluke or Flounder with support from heavy-hitter Paul Rigby (Neko Case, Garth Hudson, Leeroy Stagger, The Sadies). The result was a unique, alternative post-rock sound with the cadence of diehard traditional folk featured throughout. This recording followed a 7 year sojourn in Glasgow where he took a respite from performing while continuing to write. After this tenure of searching for purpose and inspiration, his passion for sharing story and song was reignited.\r\n\r\nReturning to Canada in 2015, Guliak’s performances and songwriting have been admired and sought out by the music community as he continues to grow a dedicated audience. His live show, often versatile in players and styles, is an engaging experience accented with authenticity and charm in exactly the right proportions helping to create an atmosphere that feels more like a conversation than a performance. His whiskey and cigarettes baritone has been described in Nerve Magazine as, "one of those character voices that should almost be trademarked."  \r\n\r\nWhether globetrotting among the nameless or humbly coaxing crowds on stage, John Guliak’s songwriting is a treasure unlike any other. His dedication to exploring points of connection both captivates and refreshes anyone who is lucky enough to end up in his presence. Among the polished branding of mainstream culture, Guliak’s candour is a soft reminder of the purpose for art and understanding.\r\n\r\nIn 2015 and 2016 he attended the Musician in Residence Program at The Banff Arts Centre, he also attended a 3 week residency at Rest For the Wicked in Brussels, Belgium in 2018. In 2019 he attended a 10 day writing workshop in Nashville at the home of Linda McRae with support from the Canada Council for the Arts. 2020 has him ready to release 3 new digital EPs: Fisherman, Farmer, Fool and planning to stay safe until things approach normal again.

876	Jacob Rose is a singer-songwriter based in Calgary AB, and St. Stephen NB, who writes across many genres, his style traversing rock, hip-hop, folk and pop. In 2016, his song “Marco Polo” was a finalist in the Roots/Folk and Country categories at the YYCMusic Awards in Calgary. Compared to the likes of Mumford & Sons, Ed Sheeran and the Barenaked Ladies, Rose has carved out a space for his own distinct sound that separates him from other artists.

915	To call Canada your home can be a very vague statement. From the Rockies, all the way to the eastern shores of the Atlantic, there are many places one can lay their head. It’s not only the sheer distance between the two coasts, it’s the cultural differences that exist within them. Rube & Rake’s debut album, Back and Forth, explores this theme with a subtle grace, giving space in their arrangements to explore the issues they sing about. By performing as a two-piece, they’ve found a way to put an emphasis on their lyrical delivery. Whether a song is performed with a four-piece string band, or just a banjo and a guitar, the duo has stories to tell.\r\nEvery song has a story behind it. Whether it’s the acceptance that there are loved ones you will never see again, the memories you make having to hitchhike on highways with no town in sight, or a series of natural disasters, there is a definite stamp of “Canadiana” on this album. Using these subjects as muses have helped set a tone to their live show. Often described as a darker Simon and Garfunkel, Rube & Rake’s performances engage audiences with a mixture of stories, intricate guitar work, and rich vocal harmonies. After working together for the past 5 years out of St. John’s, Newfoundland, Josh Sandu and Andrew Laite have fused an intimate musical cohesion that is only achieved through getting to know each other’s tendencies. Their music is an exercise in creating something beyond the sum of their parts.

916	Philip Adams has emerged from the Paris of the Prairies along with his indie/alternative tunes over the past three years. Philip comes from the musical goldmine with the likes of Joni Mitchell, The Sheepdogs, and Bombargo, and adds his own voice to the “Mosaic” of Saskatoon. The self taught musician/producer’s first released song, “Mosaic”, was recorded on old, worn out guitar strings to symbolize the beauty that comes from what others may disregard and ignore- not realizing the beauty and art within theirselves. Written after hearing two peoples life stories and tragic pasts, Philip did the only thing he knew, which was to capture their stories in song. “Mosaic” is meant to bring hope to those hurting or broken. “12” was written with intent of showing all listeners that they are beautiful. After a night on the beach with a friend who didn’t see her beauty, Philip expressed it through sing. Anyone who listens can place themselves within the lyrics. “You”, the most romantic song and namesake of his EP, can encompass all loving relationships with the compatible lyrics. Last, but not least, “TV love” (PG 13 Netflix and chill) has a catchy beat and a combination of string and synth sounds that will be sure to get caught in your head all day (and you won’t be mad about it).\r\n\r\nPhilip’s live performance is so unique that you will want to hear more just to experience his style. He uses a loop pedal, guitar, keyboard, and loop mic to give you a full band experience from a solo artist. He begins each loop with a single instrument, and each layer grows in dynamics and depth as more are added. You will leave each performance with a unique music experience. \r\n	["music"]	[]	\N	\N	Philip Adams	13063216006	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1547505267/artist/916/cover_photo.png	2019-01-10 22:31:29.664+00	2019-03-09 05:28:33.672+00	\N	\N	[{"index":0,"publicId":"artist/916/hi-res/0.jpg","version":1547505579}]	[{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/philipadamsmusic/"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/philipadamsmusic/"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"https://philipadamsmusic.wixsite.com/philipadams"},{"mediaType":"youtubeChannel","url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuf4qzycNIXuxbOowuuafAQ?view_as=subscriber"}]	Philip Adams has emerged from the Paris of the Prairies along with his indie tunes over the past three years.

880	Kris Schofield is an Ontario born Finnish-Canadian photographer based out of Calgary, Alberta. After several years of falling in and out of photography while searching for his voice, he tried his hand in a variety of genres within photography: Live music, Motorsports, Street photography etc. All of these had varying degrees of satisfaction, but there was still something missing. It wasn't until one particular long weekend, that included a lot of coffee, early mornings with equally late nights and close to 1200 kms of driving solo on vacant gravel roads that he discovered the beauty within the stark prairie landscape that is so predominant here in Alberta. It was then Kris finally found the voice he had been searching for. \r\n\r\nIf asked, Kris would tell you that his mind races a mile a minute and when you look at his photography, you can see how the process of creation calms his mind. Specializing in minimalist, black and white photography, Schofield focuses heavily on dark, negative space, giving a whisper of light to his subject. In doing this, he draws not just the emotions of the viewer out, but shows the viewer what he was feeling. In short, the images Kristofer creates are a piece of himself.

1073	Cam Thiessen is all about writing songs that, when performed, grab and maintain the attention of the audience. This is accomplished through subverting status-quo singer-songwriter chord progressions, utilizing a vast dynamic range, skillful guitar playing, and an approach to songwriting that hinges on intense research into the history of songwriting in various popular music genres.

1783	Survivor and singer of cautionary tales. You want it, you got it from Tom Phillips, whose career’s turned itself inside out so often that at times he appears to be a shape shifter. During the past few years, Phillips’ transformation was also physical as he swapped alcohol for coffee and his trademark cowboy boots and shirts for polished shoes and tailored suits. But appearances distract, and Phillips is no shape shifter: if you took a musical x-ray during every incarnation, you’d find song writing as the bedrock under the suits, boots, cowboy hats and skin. Which explains why revered blues artist Eric Bibb covered Phillips’ touchstone tune, Ribbons and Bows, on one of his albums. An esteemed statesperson of the Calgary music scene, Phillips earned his laurels over decades. He recorded with Gordon Lightfoot’s band in Toronto before releasing several albums, both live and in studio, with his legendary long time honky-tonk band The Men of Constant Sorrow (MOCS). He also released an acoustic solo album, paid homage to Hank Williams on the Sorrow Bound project, and smashed his comfort zone with a daring, darling album of cover songs from punk and rock territory. He’s often found anchoring musical gatherings that celebrate the songs of Haggard, Dylan, Springsteen and Lightfoot. The evolution continues on his most recent work with the D.T.’s (Difficult Transitions). The band formed serendipitously at bars and open stages, learning Phillips’ most recent songs onstage just in time for his last record. With MOCS veteran Tim Leacock (The Co-Dependents), Ian Grant (Art Bergmann, Cat Ranch), Geoff Brock and sisters Shaye and Sydney Zadravec, the D.T.’s translate Phillips’ songs into live performances that deliver musical delights which offer style without flash. So take a musical walk with Phillips and gaze at life through his seasoned eyes. He’s got it covered with a hundred songs that undress truths so simple they’re frightening. Ever cheated on a lover, driven home drunk, been bucked off your horse, or been the last person in the bar when the lights came up? If you’ve been stranded on the highway, woken up in the wrong bed, walked home barefoot in a ball gown in the morning rain, or wished you could have a re-do on any of these choices, Phillips has a song for you.

954	The road that led Sue Turner to a life as a singer-songwriter was far from a straight line. She moved to San Francisco in the 80's to study medicine, where the power of music, art and activism did not escape her attention.  On her 38th birthday at Vancouver's legendary Blues club, The Yale, she had an epiphany that started her love affair with music.  Over the last nearly 2 decades she has combined medicine and music, until now.  She says, "there is no appropriate age or time to shoot yourself out of a rocket into your biggest dreams, so how about now ?  This highly motivated, passionate and unstoppable doctor turned musician is out to fulfill on her new mantra, “Let’s get carried away !”\r\n\r\nSue has recorded 2 albums, most recently, Later is a Lie, a collection of sublimely humorous, quirky and lyrically poignant tunes, produced by Vancouver's John Ellis. What you experience when you hear Sue’s music is a unique and intimate sound that sits somewhere between the two tremendously expressive worlds of acoustic singer-songwriter and contemporary jazz and blues. Her performances are infused with a warm, listenable familiarity.  She tells the truth in a way that at first may\r\n go unnoticed. By the end of the evening, you have been drawn into a world where authenticity rules. \r\n\r\nThe Sue Turner Band duo features Sue Turner and Bruce Fraser. On keyboard, guitar, mandolin, Dulcimer, they perform her original tunes and some of the greatest cover tunes they have ever heard. \r\n \r\n	["music"]	[]	Age 30 + jazz, blues and folk fans 	\N	Sue Turner 	604 - 720 - 7830	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1548879613/artist/954/cover_photo.jpg	2019-01-30 20:19:39.273+00	2019-03-09 05:28:33.684+00	Alberta: April 21 - 29th and after June 5th \r\nToronto: May 4 - 13th \r\nHalifax: May 17 - 24th 	[{"name":"Gallery Bistro ","date":"2018/06"},{"name":"The Waldorf  ","date":"2018/04"},{"name":"A Christmas Spectrum Kelowna ","date":"2018/12"}]	[{"index":0,"publicId":"artist/954/hi-res/0.jpg","version":1548972862},{"index":1,"publicId":"artist/954/hi-res/1.jpg","version":1548973009},{"index":2,"publicId":"artist/954/hi-res/2.jpg","version":1548973030}]	[{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/SueTurnerBand/"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/sueturnermusic/"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"http://www.sueturnermusic.com/"},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://sueturner.bandcamp.com/album/later-is-a-lie-2","metadata":{"type":"album","id":"484742128"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://sueturner.bandcamp.com/album/all-my-graces","metadata":{"type":"album","id":"347576630"}},{"mediaType":"youtubeChannel","url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPaUNost0YIhJy-2ymgCTFA"}]	She has combined music and medicine for nearly 2 decades.

Inspired by the musical styles of the early to mid-20th century, Portman’s transportive music has been described as clever, touching and sassy. In addition to strumming her ukulele she creatively incorporates percussion into her performances using suitcases, beaded purses and her heeled shoes. When not performing solo or as a duo with her guitarist, she performs with her band, The Good Find and has released two recordings, Lovin’ and Take a Trip. The later recording inspired Portman to create the train themed show Take a Trip: A Musical Journey Capitol Theatre at Fort Edmonton Park in 2016. \r\n\r\nFor Portman’s solo performances she includes her ‘luggage looper’ into the mix to record and build rhythmic layers using her suitcases and their contents. The added percussion enriches her original and standard songs, vocals, ukulele and guitar work. It’s a contemporary twist on her vintage vibe sound that’s creative, playful and in the moment. \r\n\r\nFor 2020 Portman created a curbside concert called Under the Blue Skies.

877	Conscious Club is an indie group formed in 2018, with a distinct persona and sound. Conscious Club originated from Calgary, Alberta, Canada. It's 5 members hail from different corners of the musical spectrum while sharing the same overarching idea of creating intimate, and easy-going music. While their image projects a more laid-back collective, Conscious Club delves into masked mature themes like abuse, commitment, and aging under layers of tremolo, chorus, and reverb. The fivesome had played before in bands - but didn't become Conscious Club till 2018 when all members met through high school. The groups tight-knit, and goofball antics allow them to discover the uncharted plains of their sound, leaving the groups sound malleable to modern recording techniques. Their unorthodox way of constructing a studio sound adapted to the live stage leaves a creative and evolving sound that can't be missed.\r\nUsually bring along equally as talented vocalists and performers to tag along.

1046	PsychOnCall is story and song that also represents a musical concept and approach. I am a Psychiatrist in Calgary and have been collecting stories (life-long) that speak to our Mental Health, our Mental Illness, and our Existance. I create this music for all, but perhaps direct my message mostly to those touched in some way by Psychiatric and Existential challenge. My lyrics and poetry organize around levels from bio-poetic science to relational theory, from neurons to community, from sensation to theology, and from suffering to healing. My musical leanings and influences are too broad to name, but my vibe is singer songwriter. My musical hope is to connect and share more broadly with people, and to help out in any way I can.

1165	Kenny is currently on a year long tour from Austin, Texas to Alaska and back. Born in Oklahoma, raised in the small East Texas town of Flint, and a wanderer ever since, Kenny Freeman’s music is a distinct mixture of his life so far. Sounds of Texas Blues & Americana mix with a soulful voice sharing personal stories of heartache and hard times. All of this coming together to take a look at a life on the road less traveled, and providing a glimpse into the heart of a hard worn traveler.\r\n\r\nA third generation musician, Kenny was constantly surrounded by jam sessions comprised of his father, his uncle and their friends. He would wait patiently, sitting in the corner listening, until it was his turn to step forward and play whatever instrument was available. At a young age he found Eric Clapton and Stevie Ray Vaughan, which led him on a never ending journey into the depths of blues history. Mix that in with a love for songwriters like Townes Van Zandt, Ray Wylie Hubbard, and Lyle Lovett, what is conjured is a unique mix that elicits thoughts of the past and a hard traveled road ahead.\r\n\r\nAfter five years in Nashville touring extensively both as an acoustic act and with his full band, The Smokey Gringos, it was time for a change. This ‘change’ led to a 24 hour journey across the Pacific and into the heart of Asia. What resulted was 15 months spent throughout Korea and Southeast Asia playing music, teaching English, exploring new places, and writing new songs.\r\n\r\nAfter a few years in Austin, Texas, it was time to hit the road again. This time with a whole new slew of tunes ready to go and a live record.

The Varmoors chemistry is the result of growing up together and being best friends for over a decade. The band was formed in 2015 and they have grown exponentially together ever since. The Varmoors are a band of brothers held together by their love for classic rock, good times and adventure.\r\n\r\nThe Varmoors sound can be described as a wall of guitars that move, shake and rock the house. Melodic tones and tasty riffs encompass the wide range of influences that the band has.  From the greats like Jimi Hendrix, The Rolling Stones, The Doors, all the way to new cats like Jack White, The Black Keys, The War on Drugs and The Sheepdogs. With heavy hitting drums driving the song and a rhythm section that carries the beat, The Varmoors are a band that makes everyone want to dance.

959	Singer-songwriter-pianist Jeffery Straker performs over 100 shows each year across Canada and abroad. He’s recorded for CBC radio’s ‘Canada Live’, had a music video chart in the top 10 nationwide and has toured internationally playing pianos in places as far away as Mexico, Chile and Peru.  His folk-pop hooks and rootsy story-telling have been featured in film, TV, and theatrical productions while he maintains a touring schedule in venues ranging from house concerts to theatres and festivals.  Additionally, Straker has performed concerts of his songs with several symphony orchestras.  On the international stage, Jeffery was the winner of the Vina Del Mar International Song Competition in Chile in 2014 representing Canada where he performed each night to a live audience of 20,000 and a TV audience of 150,000,000 viewers across the Spanish-speaking world.  Originally from small town Saskatchewan (Punnichy - population 300), the classically trained pianist was raised by a church organist mother and an auctioneer father. He swears he was born under the piano on the family farm.\r\n     Jeffery’s latest album Dirt Road Confessional (May 2017) launched at #5 on the iTunes Canada singer songwriter charts, & has played on CBC radio and college radio across the country.  The recording saw him booked on his first European tour and earned him a debut performance at Canada's National Arts Centre in Ottawa.  This recent recording, as well as several of his earlier albums, have drawn comparisons to the likes of Harry Chapin, Kris Kristofferson, Jackson Browne and a young Billy Joel.\r\n     The artist has launched seven albums over the last 10 years to both warm critical and fan response with several climbing into the iTunes Canada top 10 singer-songwriter charts.  A new album is in the works for launch in 2019. \r\n	["music"]	[]	30+	\N	Jeffery Straker	4168820992	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1548908167/artist/959/cover_photo.jpg	2019-01-31 04:15:25.601+00	2019-03-09 05:28:33.686+00	\N	[{"name":"Calgary Folk Festival","date":"2017/07"},{"name":"National Arts Centre - Ottawa ON","date":"2018/11"},{"name":"TCU Place Saskatoon SK, with the Saskatoon Symphony Orchestra","date":"2018/10"}]	[{"index":0,"publicId":"artist/959/hi-res/0.jpg","version":1548908220}]	[{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/jeffery.straker.music/"},{"mediaType":"twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/jefferystraker"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/jefferystraker"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"https://www.jeffstraker.com/"},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://jefferymichaelstraker.bandcamp.com/track/walking-shoes","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"2839952010"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://jefferymichaelstraker.bandcamp.com/track/beauty-in-the-grey","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"2798898533"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://jefferymichaelstraker.bandcamp.com/track/get-what-you-give","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"2038733117"}},{"mediaType":"embeddedYoutube","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck7a1FNEF-c"}]	Singer-songwriter-pianist with "rootsy storytelling and folk-pop hooks".

While the bands have been a source of great music, friends, and life changing moments,  van Kampen has taken to exploring his music in a deeper, more personal way, and with a more intimate connection to the listener.  Music is more than bells and whistles.  There's something to be said for the sincerity of a gorgeous melody, delicately played on a piano with the gentleness of experienced hands, and joined by the truthfulness of an honest voice.

1551	I've composed near 800 tunes and many have become standard repertoire with fiddlers in North America & Europe. Every tune has a story so my concerts always have the element of story telling and instrumental music. I grew up with 'fiddle music' in our house because my father was a fiddler. I started when I was 8 years old. I live in St. Paul but really I feel most at home, when I'm performing on a stage, even after all these years.

962	\r\nJohn has gotten himself lost out among the gently rippling tide of the reservoir. There he floats on his back with eyes closed against a warm sun. Red light filtering through slowly dissolves the weighty concerns of introspection. The outer world creeps in. Chickadees stutter, voices ring from shore, distant cars let out tireless sighs. John’s slowly circling body yields to the current of the moment. A faint vibration enters his feet and swells to his throat. \r\nPasserby stop at the sight of a sweet melody sailing to shore on a feather bed of guitars. Turning towards the reservoir, even the most tightly wound soul lulls into a sense of ease and asks itself “why am I not out there?”   \r\nLand dwellers know John as Bennett Mitchell, multi-instrumentalist and songwriter who employs all the instruments under his hands, (guitar, bass, drums, keyboards), to build jazz inspired grooves and drug inspired (not really) soundscapes worthy of standing up to his pure and flexible voice.

The band features pure and thrillingly elastic vocals with catchy arrangements of guitar, mandolin, and accordion that draw from jazz, classical, folk, and pop influences. Inspired by artists such as Owen Pallett, Joanna Newsom, Bright Eyes, The Decemberists, and the Punch Brothers, and forged from a sonically adventurous acoustic music scene on Canada’s west coast, West My Friend is proving to be a key part of a new generation of grassroots folk music.

Exploring her departure from religion, this somber and experimental record features songs which she recorded at The Banff Centre For Arts and Creativity during her 2018 BMiR residency and is co-produced by her partner Taylor Cochrane (36?).\r\n\r\nDescribed as ‘indomitable,’ Laura Hickli will shatter any expectations of the way a piano should be played, a voice should be lifted, or a life should be lived.

285	Best known in the world of fly fishing, where they are both instructors, Jim and Lynda McLennan have been involved in music for all of their adult lives. \r\nLynda McLennan has a Bachelor of Music degree and taught high-school music for many years, working with and directing choirs and bands.  Her first love, though, is singing, and in performance she puts her personal stamp on tunes from Gershwin, Foster, Berlin, and others, in a musical style that can best be described as "folk jazz."\r\nJim McLennan’s reputation as a fingerstyle guitarist, composer and arranger has produced an enduring legacy as one of Alberta’s finest guitarists. He recorded for Stefan Grossman’s iconic Kicking Mule record label in the 1970s, and has been featured in Guitar Player magazine. Jim regularly instructs guitar at the Foothills Acoustic Music Institute’s music camps near Calgary, Alberta. \r\n\r\nUpon its release, Jim's first solo CD, Six-String Gumbo, was immediately chosen "CD of the Week" by CKUA Radio’s Peter North.  The CD was a Western Canadian Music Award finalist for Instrumental Recording of the Year. Veteran music writer Alan Kellogg, writing in Penguin Eggs magazine, said this about Six-String Gumbo: \r\n\t"Six-String Gumbo is a canny collection of diverse work – stretching from Dvorak to Joplin to Billy Joel to Jerry Reed – \talong with original tunes that showcase the player’s alchemy in transforming solo guitar to a near-orchestral realm. Hackneyed “one man band” clichés just don’t cover this kind of mature artistry."\r\n\r\nThe McLennans’ 2014 CD, Dancing On Air, features Lynda’s voice and Jim’s guitar, and has received significant airplay on Alberta’s CKUA radio.\r\nA Jim and Lynda McLennan performance includes instrumental guitar pieces from Jim (many from Six-String Gumbo) and vocal tunes from Lynda. One moment it’s a “folkafied” version of a standard like Ain’t Misbehavin’ or Fly Me to the Moon, next up might be an acoustic nod to the R&B world of Sam Cooke or Curtis Mayfield. The only criteria for a McLennan interpretation of a tune is that it be a great song.\r\n\r\nMuch of their music is recognized and loved by their listeners. Seasoned performers, their genuine and engaging stage demeanor immediately puts audiences at ease. They have performed at Festival Place in Sherwood Park, the mid-Winter Roots and Blues Festival in Edmonton, the On the Edge Concert Series, Carlson’s on Macleod in High River, the Room Full of Sound concert series in Okotoks, Mikey’s Juke Joint in Calgary, the Blue Chair in Edmonton, the Canmore Folk Festival, and at numerous house concerts and other acoustic music venues.\r\n\r\nIn addition to performances, Jim often leads workshops on a variety of guitar-related topics. These often work well the afternoon of an evening performance.\r\n	["music"]	["blues","folk","jazz","other-music","rb","roots","singer-songwriter"]	Audiences of all ages interested in jazz standards and strong acoustic guitar playing.	\N	Jim McLennan	403 558 2128	mclennanflyfishing@me.com	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1564514507/artist/285/cover_photo.jpg	2017-11-13 19:56:06.005+00	2019-07-30 19:27:19.369+00	\N	[{"name":"Rocky Mountain Folk Club","date":"2019/04"},{"name":"Westwood","date":"2018/02"},{"name":"Little Concerts","date":"2017/09"}]	\N	[{"mediaType":"website","url":"https://www.mclennanflyfishing.com"},{"mediaType":"embeddedYoutube","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTgXCc6EgTc"},{"mediaType":"youtubeChannel","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTgXCc6EgTc"}]	Folkjazz with Jim and Lynda McLennan	\N	\N	originals	\N	hTgXCc6EgTc	\N	\N	\N
1240	Born and raised in Calgary Alberta and I have been singing for over 20 years. I started singing karaoke as a teen then started participating in and won several singing competitions. I was involved in the Country Music Association of Calgary and was a member of the Canadian Country Music Association for a year. I recorded a couple of CDs with Alberta's Finest and the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame, Kiss and Tell cowritten by Patricia Conroy and Leaving the Light On cowritten by Amy Sky. I've recently started performing with the jamming community and now received my busking license to take my music to more people. I would love to record a full album of songs that reflect the music that has influenced me since I was a child and also reflect this crazy world we live in.

516	Glennis Houston is a long-time performer on the Calgary scene. She has performed musical theatre, pop, blues, jazz, and her own jazz-influenced songs across western Canada. She has worked with many of the best instrumentalists in Alberta, including Sheldon Zanboer, Robin Tufts, Jeremy Coats, Andrew Glover, Mike Lent, and many others. Her second CD, "I'll Reminisce You," contains much of her own material and was recorded live "in the round" in the old National Music Centre in Calgary. \r\n\r\nHer soaring vocals hint at the classical training she received through her Masters of Music, but the classical sound has gone as she delves into contemporary material. She currently works with several group configurations - solo piano & voice; vocal duo with Deb Rasmussen where they explore the possibilities of voice with instruments; and Fifty shades of blues with Andrea Petrity (naughty blues from the 1920s). Groups can be customized according to need.

398	Hailing from Camrose, Alberta, Canada, David Andrew Wiebe is a multi-talented guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter.\r\n\r\nHe grew up in Takarazuka, Hyogo, Japan, where he went to public school from kindergarten to grade eight, and became fluent in the Japanese language.\r\n\r\nAt the time, he was immersed in manga (Japanese comics), video games and artwork. Music mostly served as a backdrop to those activities, but he recalls enjoying J-Rock duo B’z as well as J-Pop duo CHAGE&ASKA growing up.\r\n\r\nWhen Wiebe was 13, his father crashed his motorcycle into the side of a transport truck. He was in a coma for about 10 days, but ultimately passed away. It was then that the Wiebe family made the decision to move back to Canada.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Mrs. Sasaki – a friend of Wiebe’s father – offered him a nylon-string acoustic guitar. Alas, she couldn’t actually deliver the guitar before Wiebe moved back to Canada.\r\n\r\nHowever, in due course, she travelled all the way out to Drumheller, Alberta, to deliver that guitar to his grandparent’s home.\r\n\r\nThe guitar sat in Wiebe’s closet for a couple of years at his home in Calgary, Alberta, but when he saw his friend play a handful of popular songs on his guitar at summer camp, he came away determined to learn to play.\r\n\r\nAt 17, Wiebe began learning guitar at a ferocious rate, and his guitar teacher, Jason Johnson, says he surpassed him within two lessons!\r\n\r\nWiebe credits Johnson for giving him the solid foundation he needed on his instrument, and also says he owes a great deal to his other teachers and mentors: guitar repairman Tom Martin, veteran Brian Griffiths, MI graduate Shawn Johnsen, jazz instructor Jim Riley, and virtuoso Daniel Guy Martin for his growth.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Wiebe released his first solo album, Shipwrecked… My Sentiments. During production, his cousin Mitchell took his own life. It was already a tumultuous time for Wiebe, who was feeling disillusioned with multiple band projects all ending in shambles.\r\n\r\nWiebe’s musical journey, however, would continue on, and today he has multiple session playing and engineering credits to his name, including Active Light’s Active Light EP, Jonathan Ferguson’s Sweeter After Difficulties, Andrew Riches’ 12 String Monster, and Long Jon Lev's Telltale Heart.\r\n\r\nSince 2016, Wiebe has been actively releasing new music, and has added several new singles to his catalog: "Fragments", "City Lights", "Don't Wait Too Long", "Hope", "Waves", and "Your Eyes Give It Away". In 2018, he also re-released the Demos 2010 compilation as Fire Your God, and has plans of sharing more new music with the world.

1246	Tides On Earth has an eclectic sound combining a vast mix of musical genres into one. A positive message typically drives the music. As the name, Tides On Earth suggests, environmentally conscious with an emphasis to reflect on ourselves. Add a unique way of blending storytelling through folk with bridges that often elevate the intensity of the song through the use of spoken word. That's Tides On Earth. The term Spoke/Folk (a term coined by Ryan) is meant to convey the cross-genre vibes of acoustic tones and a good beat, blended seamlessly with the rhythmic intensity of Spoken Word. Live looping and pre-composed backing tracks will leave the listener hearing more than simply an acoustic guitar and a single voice. \r\n\r\nHere's what Tides On Earth's most recent venue said about his music: \r\n\r\n"Ryan from Tides On Earth.

He was brought up on a musical diet of Cash, Jones, Haggard, Willie Nelson Hank Snow and Don Gibson as well as folk heroes such as Hiatt, Prine and Rodney Crowell. His teens and twenties saw Elvis Costello, Blue Rodeo and others thrown into the mix of influences and later the Mavericks, Tom Phillips and Corb Lund among many others too numerous to mention. Calgary’s music scene and venues (A Bar Named Sue, Karma Café, Kayos, the King Eddy, The Ironwood, Mikey’s, the Palomino and the Ship among others) provided the opportunity to get to know and then play with many of Calgary and Alberta’s household names.

439	My name is Kristine St-Pierre and I'm a bilingual folk singer-songwriter from Ottawa. I em embarking on a cross-Canada tour in April-May to promote my latest album "La promesse" which was released in November 2017. I will be in Calgary from May 4 to 6 and was hoping to perform in smaller venues, including cafes or breweries.\r\n\r\nIn addition to my new album, I have released two bilingual albums, Call Me Crazy (2012) and Stand Still for A While (2010). My style is a mix of introspective finger-picked folky ballads and rollicking, bluesy melodies.  It's been described as fresh and raw. \r\n\r\n"Think of a young Joni Mitchell's or Jann Arden's style and wordplay, occasionally venturing into Sarah McLachlan territory, with an efferverscent stage presence and a smile a mile wide."\r\n\r\n“From her light, delicate finger picking to the stomp of her feet, you can hear Kristine St-Pierre’s sould baring itself to the audience with every melody.”\r\n\r\nA few recent highlights:\r\n- The single La promesse was released to radio in the fall and is currently #2 on Ici Musique.\r\n- I performed in Ukraine as part of a festival celebrating La Francophonie in June 2017.\r\n- I was nominated for best female artist at the 2015 Gala des Prix trille or.\r\n- I was nominated for a Canadian Folk Music Award in 2016 with my band Old Whiskey Road.\r\n\r\nYou can listen to my music here: www.kristinestpierre.com/music\r\n\r\nThanks!

1100	There is a distinct vulnerability in Canadian singer-songwriter Zach Kleisinger’s music. With a voice that is deep, slow, and soaked in sorrow, he reflects on the human condition with stories that chronicle everyday moments. The characters in his songs are crushed by broken relationships, financial problems, failing careers, and are oftentimes unable to understand their own anguish. They are also possessed by love and introspection, by their passions and aspirations; but are seldom guilty of refusing their own failures and flaws. These characters exist in a world of wholesome melodies that are deliberate and embracing; leaving those who live there with a hope and yearning for the future. Zach Kleisinger’s songs will sink into special places within and remind us of the brevity of our time on this earth.\r\n\r\nHis second EP, entitled “I Hope Its Calm, Then”, was released on March 30th of 2018, and showcases a delicately refined sound by the young Canadian. The EP began in Montreal when the songwriter was closing out a cross-Canada tour. The album is raw, honest, and asks the listener to reflect on how temporary life is. Zach explains, “I think that’s how the recording of these songs began, in that they were built on a feeling that something inside of me was no longer. I look at it now and see that I had a collection of small crisis building on top of one another. There were a few failed relationships, I had run into some trouble with the law, and many people had come and gone from my life in a very short period of time. There wasn’t much around that I trusted.”\r\n\r\nAfter the release of his 2018 EP Zach embarked on two tours of Canada, pulling audiences into the vulnerability of his performances. Recently, he has spent time in the studio, and is prepared to release new music in 2019.

440	​Chris Strei has been observing and studying music since adolescence, well before he chose to pursue music professionally. In 2010, this led him to go to Recording Arts Canada in Toronto to study audio engineering and release 3 projects, written and produced by himself. With no family roots in music, it's tough to say where his passion comes from, it's just always been there. Butch Walker, Johnny Cash, and Tom Petty's influence can be heard in his original work, but his love for music in general has always been a major influence on his writing style. This has led him to the opportunities of opening for The Trews and performing at The Bluebird Cafe in Nashville. Chris is truly at home when he's on stage and keeps a close connection to his roots as a music fan by also including a mix of his favourite artists in his list of songs. To broaden his search of these performance opportunities, Chris joined the NSAI, SAC, and CMAO in January 2018.

1544	"if Mumford & Sons ever held a Super-Jam with Arcade Fire, it might sound something like The Royal Foundry's new single "Running Away." - [Grant Lawrence, CBC Music]\r\n\r\nThe Royal Foundry is a Canadian Indie-Alt-Pop band anchored by husband and wife Jared Salte and Beth Schumacher, along with touring band members Robbie Szabo and Jeremy Dehek.\r\nFounded in 2013 what started as a folk-duo quickly evolved into an in- die-alt-pop quartet. They were thrown into the spotlight when their music video “All We Have” received attention from local radio station Sonic 102.9. The video went “indie-viral” quickly hitting 50,000 views on YouTube. Their first alt-pop single ‘Running Away’ released in 2015 was their first journey into Alternative music. Shortly after it’s release it climbed the Alt-Rock Charts across Canada to #23. (the only indie band on the chart at the time)\r\nAfter playing multiple cross-Canada tours and being introduced into touring in the US through tours and extensive showcasing, The Royal Foundry gained popularity and accolades with their album “Lost In Your Head” earning them numerous awards and nominations from the WCMA’s, EMA’s, Lennon Awards and many more. Their album has since then had three Alt-Rock Top 40 Singles with “Never Have Time, Running Away and Dreamers.”\r\n\r\nRecently, with the release of their new album ‘WAKEUP WAKEUP’, The Royal Foundry has continued to push their success, growing and maturing as artists, enveloping and experimenting with unique instrumentals and daring compositions.\r\n\r\nOver their short career they've had the opportunity to share the stage with Twenty One Pilots, Halsey, The Lumineers, The Arkells, July Talk, Hollerado etc...

1858	John Wiebe is a Canadian musician, songwriter, producer, public speaker and singer, whose vocals is often noted as a blend of The Calling and Lifehouse. Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, John’s undying passion for music began at an early age and served as an outlet to escape a harsh reality of depression and anxiety. From learning the guitar and dabbling in lyricism between 7th and 8th grade, to writing and composing original music, he released his debut EP entitled “Changed” during high school. \r\n\r\nConstantly tearing down barriers, John’s fervent drive and ‘never giving up’ attitude defied all odds. Despite being born 4 months premature, to people saying he would never make it in music, and only having one working vocal cord, John was featured in the Fort Saskatchewan Newspaper after giving a memorable performance at a local music festival in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta in 2016, and was nominated for a People’s Choice Award at the 2017 Edmonton Music Awards. Building on the momentum, John refined his skills and talents over the years, releasing his “Fearless” album in 2017 and dropped another single titled “Let Go” in 2019 in the follow up to his upcoming EP entitled “Basement Tapes”. \r\n\r\nInfluenced by artists such as NF, Skillet, Ed Sheeran, Simple Plan, Manafest and Eminem, John’s raspy vocals and sound lyricism elicits a joyfulness that instantly bridges a lasting connection with listeners. \r\n\r\nGaining new fans with every track, his lyrical ingenuity and fearless artistry is fuelled by his pure will of overcoming past experiences and difficult life situations. \r\n\r\nAlways looking towards the future, John plans to take his music career to the next level by touring, releasing new music and performing at major festivals both nationally and internationally. Echoing a seamless mix of Alternative and Pop, John continues to be a triumphant inspiration to others.

Their music is eclectic and the way they deliver it to audiences is often kinda funny and always, well, compelling.  Or to put another way, in attending a Douglas Brothers show, audiences can expect to laugh, but also sometimes cry or quietly sniffle and, in the very least, be surprised (in a nice way). They are veterans of folk festivals and concert stages, but are most at home in small intimate settings like house concerts and community halls where, as Wayne says, “we find that the snacks are often quite good.” 	["music"]	["folk","singer-songwriter"]	Anyone who likes singer-songwriter music, stories and to laugh.	\N	Mark Wonneck	403-710-4460	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1523982878/artist/502/cover_photo.jpg	2018-04-16 23:46:11.678+00	2019-03-09 05:28:33.467+00	October 1-18, 25-31\r\nNovember 1-14, 20-30\r\nDecember on\r\n	[{"name":"MacLeod House Concert, Calgary, AB","date":"2018/09"},{"name":"The Duncan Showroom, Duncan BC","date":"2018/05"},{"name":"Nanoose Bay Community Centre, Nanoose Bay, BC","date":"2018/05"}]	[]	[{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/douglas.brothers"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"https://www.reverbnation.com/thedouglasbrothers"},{"mediaType":"youtubeChannel","url":"https://www.youtube.com/user/DouglasBrothersMusic"}]		\N	\N	originals	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

532	Here’s the thing about Alex, he knows how to play. \r\nMake no mistake, he knows how to work too -no one teaches themselves to play the fiddle that well without work- but it’s what he does with the spoils of the effort that sets him apart: he plays. With every leap and holler the word conjures, he throws himself into his instruments and leaves nothing out. And in the spaces between that joyful riot Alex cuts in, clear and strong, with the words of his heart. \r\n\r\nAlex grew up halfway in Montreal, the rest in Calgary, and has spent most of the musical years of his life playing with his band Rotary Park; touring everywhere from Cape Breton to Vancouver Island. His songs share the melodies of those places and tell of the lessons he’s learned there. With his first EP he continues to cast out into the world with a deep curiosity and, as always, a sense of play.

Allan was born and raised on Cape Breton Island into a musical culture so vibrant, it wasn’t long before he picked up the strings and joined in with the kitchen parties and bonfires, and then on to playing many bars and pubs in Nova Scotia and Northern Alberta.  \r\nRationale covers a wide range of music in their own acoustic style - from Joni Mitchell to Justin Bieber, Fleetwood Mac to Beyoncé, Miranda Lambert to the White Stripes.

573	ba:zel is the electroacoustic love child of Daniel Vlček and Ewelina Chiu, born in 2014 on a whim when the two were near strangers. The project features Ewelina on vocals, soprano flute, keyboard, and midi pedal and Daniel on bass guitar, beats, and synths. ba:zel is a precarious balance between startling fragility and massively dark undertones, post-grime beats mingled with the neo-classical, connected by a soprano insidious to some, child-like and secretive to others. The project has been variously labelled as “frosty minimalism” (BeeHype), “nightmare electro-pop” (AlterEcho), “chilly art-hop” (RadioWave), and “music for sleep-deprived ravers” (180 a.m collective). \r\n\tSince forming ba:zel has played many concerts both at home and abroad, developed its sound, and taken to using its own projections during concerts, prompting Beehype’s description of the project as “a heady postmodern audiovisual dialogue.”  ba:zel sound spans genres and works in intimate atmospheres as well as a larger stage. As RadioWave aptly puts, “ba:zel’s sound is as at home in an art gallery as it is in a nightclub.” \r\n\tIn February of 2016, ba:zel released its first single 'agave.' Shortly thereafter ba:zel released its second single 'PACE,' and on 20 June 2016 its debut album 'eye draw(s) the line.'  In August 2016 ba:zel was one of six projects nominated for CZECHING, a project run by the national Czech radio striving to support Czech music abroad. Within the scope of this project, ba:zel was voted number one by Czech radio listeners.  ba:zel asked four Czech producers to remix their track ‘PACE’ and collaborated with Slovenian producer Gasper Santl reworking the track ‘Mandatory.’  These tracks were put out on the RMX EP in April 2017 followed closely by the Scene 7 EP, noted for its evolution in the project’s sound as “overall braver and bolder” (DNA Muzyki).\r\n\tOver the course of 2015-16, ba:zel worked with documentary film maker Andrea Culkova, supplying three tracks to her newest work, H*ART ON. The film premiered at the International Leipzeg Festival for Documentary and Animated Films (DOK) in 2016. In addition to creating its own brand of electro-acoustic music, ba:zel works with creating conceptual soundtracks and experimental improvisations, both independently and in collaboration with visual artists and performers. ba:zel performed at the applied acoustics festival Gold Rain in Cologne in 2015 and played an improvisational live set to the silent soviet avant-garde film Salt for Svanetia (1930) at the Jihlava International Documentary Film Festival in 2016. Recently ba:zel collaborated with Brooklyn based artist Kara Rooney, performing live with her performance "Translation," at the Meetfactory in Prague. ba:zel also provided the sound for the Na Shledanou gallery's virtual reality project and Czech painter Josef Bolf’s installation “Sapnunngsobgen,” recently bought by the Czech National Gallery.

626	DETRACTIONS are "Calgary's communal sweatfest" (Beatroute, 2017), a pulsing, moving and shaking musical act dedicated to tearing down the walls between audience and artist. Despite early experimentation with punk and surf, the riff heavy and crushingly dark rock and roll that DETRACTIONS has evolved into is a testament to wanting to push and expand, to constantly change and adapt. Uncomfortably candid lyrics, whiplash inducing genre changes and leave-it-all-on-the-floor energy all collide into a live show that you cannot miss. \r\n\r\nFormed in 2012, DETRACTIONS has played with acts such as MxPx, OBNOX, Har Mar Superstar, Teenage Bottlerocket and Sam Coffey and the Irong Lungs. They have played events such as the 2017 BIG Winter Classic, Bowlapalooza in Canmore, the Attainable Records Launch Party, Palloween (both 2015 and 2016), and the 2015 Beatroute Christmas Party. \r\n\r\nAfter going through numerous lineup changes, things finally solidified when Shawn Savard (Random Task Collective, THEBOBBYHILLS) joined on bass in 2015 and Gus Rendell (The Blind Roots, Planned Bastard, Cheer) got behind the drums in 2016, joining original members Nathan Iles and Jesse Gillett. Shawn's pounding bass and Gus's wild animal drumming perfectly complimented Jesse's wailing leads and Nathan's furious rhythm and howled poetry. The collaboration between these four is key; there is no one song writer in DETRACTIONS. Every song gets torn apart and built back up by all four, resulting in a sound that embodies their wildly varying tastes and sensibilities. \r\n\r\nAfter joining the Transistor 66 Records roster, DETRACTIONS released their latest EP, "JORTS" on January 6th, 2017. On May 11th of the same year, the band was awarded a Telus Storyhive grant of $10,000 to film a music video for "Frankenstyle". And they're just getting started; with touring, a split with Less Miserable on Rhodehouse Records and more music videos on the horizon, the future is trashy and awesome for DETRACTIONS. DO THE LUCID SHAKE ALL NIGHT LONG.

650	For years, eastern influence has found its way into Crack the Lens' songs as a result of frontman Justin Wilson's childhood Nova Scotian summers and drummer Aiden Dunne's Newfoundland upbringing. With the release of the band's 3rd album, The Armoury (Fall 2018), the band decided to highlight that this new album really is a coming together of everyone's influence and ideas. Thus, CTL decided to slightly alter their moniker from the Gaelic-inspired "Craic the Lens" to the band's current spelling; a sort of new beginning to showcase the collaboration of four guys with varied influence - not just a couple guys who like Celtic tunes. The songs are loud, the drums are fast, the vocals are gritty. It's an album meant to be turned up.

1674	On his new album Lonesome Stretch Of Highway, Mike Plume is reborn. Its nine tracks bear the Edmonton singer/songwriter’s distinctive mark, but with an added crackling energy that’s a byproduct of hard-won experience.\r\n\r\nHaving first arrived on the scene in the midst of the alt-country insurgency of the early 1990s, Plume and his loyal band have logged countless miles around the globe, touring with the likes of Steve Earle, The Mavericks, John Hiatt and others, while befriending legends such as Levon Helm and Stompin’ Tom Connors. The lessons he’s learned along the way have left an indelible mark on Lonesome Stretch Of Highway, with songs such as “Younger Than We Are Today,” “It’s A Long Way” (featuring The Road Hammers), and “Perfume And Gasoline” destined to take a place among his best-loved tunes.\r\n\r\nPlume has long been known for his richly detailed storytelling style and unyielding devotion to rock and roll’s original spirit. That’s all present on Lonesome Stretch Of Highway, powered by Plume’s earthy, uncompromising voice. That combination is proof that one of Canada’s most accomplished singer/songwriters remains at the top of his game and is ready to hit that highway again.

610	Some call it “math-rock for home-schooled kids,” others say things like “avant-punk-jazz” while most scream “dear god, why is that man-boy dressed like a princess and destroying a baby doll?” drowned out by otherworldly guitar noise. These two prairie kids (currently surviving in Saskatoon, SK) have been making a mess since 2011, touring all over the country at a ridiculous pace. A wicked combination of tripped-out heavy-as-hell compositions and a wild, engaging, intimate stage presence. Not to be missed.

627	Hattie’s sophomore album, “Seance,” (Oct 2018) is as much a meditation on the heartbreak of growing up, and out, of our concrete youth, as it is a spaghetti western made by a wigged-out auteur director on psychedelics. The album bends time and sound between end-of-the-century grunge, surf-rock and outlaw country.\r\n\r\nAs a solo artist, Hattie transcends genres within his own created dimension of grunge-pop, creating dusty, lyrical songs that send you do the edge of your own world, while keeping you grounded with the pop savvy he cut his teeth on many moons ago. While much of today’s popular music takes influence from the past, with country and rock acts replicating the days of old, Hattie is the last of a dying cowboy breed. An outlaw at the door of the apocalypse, a cigarette in his mouth, waiting for something to give, listening to The Smiths in one ear and the Smashing Pumpkins in the other.” - Spencer Oakes, The Negative Space\r\n	["music"]	[]		\N	Jason Hattie	 3062600207	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1533094316/artist/627/cover_photo.png	2018-08-01 03:26:27.752+00	2019-03-09 05:28:33.535+00	\N	[{"name":"opening for Peach Pit, Amigo’s, Saskatoon, SK","date":"2017/10"},{"name":"opening for Lido Pimienta, MoSoFest, Saskatoon, SK","date":"2016/06"},{"name":"Astral Harvest Music Festival, AB","date":"2016/07"}]	[{"index":0,"publicId":"artist/627/hi-res/0.png","version":1533094940},{"index":1,"publicId":"artist/627/hi-res/1.jpg","version":1533095133},{"index":2,"publicId":"artist/627/hi-res/2.jpg","version":1533095299}]	[{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/hattiekarate/"},{"mediaType":"twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/HattieKarate"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/hattiekarate/"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"http://www.hattiemusic.com"},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"http://hattiemusic.bandcamp.com/album/karate","metadata":{"type":"album","id":"3798156937"}},{"mediaType":"embeddedYoutube","url":"https://youtu.be/TKmIXDZfBmw"}]	Hattie’s is as much a meditation on the heartbreak of growing up, and out, of our concrete youth, as it is a spaghetti western made by a wigged-out auteur director on psychedelics.	grunge	["alternative","western"]	originals	\N	TKmIXDZfBmw	\N	\N	\N
1584	The Lovebullies (Paul Jahn, Joni Brent, Chantal Vitalis and Caroline Connolly) have been playing together for over a  decade. Their vintage-pop-rock vibe, combined with a high octane visually dynamic stage show, makes them favourites of the Calgary music scene. They have entertained crowds at Juno Fest, Tour of Alberta, South Country Fair, East Coulee Music Festival, Women's Marches, AMPIA Awards, Calgary's White Hat Awards, many high end corporate and municipal events along with private parties, weddings and house concerts.They've had the pleasure of warming up the stage for acts such as The Beach Boys, Alex Cuba, George Canyon, Big Sugar and The B-52's. In June of 2019 they were thrilled to have taped an hour of original music for the television show Stampede City Sessions. Connolly and Vitalis compose songs that have won awards and accolades and have been featured in television, feature film and music videos. Along with finishing their third studio album of original material (to be released in 2020), they also proudly contributed a track to the Calgary Folk Festival's 40th Anniversary record entitled "Cover Art" (recorded at The National Music Centre). Honey-soaked lead vocals, electrifying guitar, raw and rambunctious bass and drums, on point harmonies and a good-looking wardrobe are the elements that make The Lovebullies a highly watchable, fun and funny band. Throw in highly original tunes that celebrate vintage pop and rock: now it's a party!

592	Free the Cynics (Rich Paxton, Brad Wedekind, Joey DeCosse and Erik Juergens) are a Calgary four-piece who have a no-limits approach to songwriting. With healthy lashings of everything from Indie Rock, Blues, Punk and Jazz to Britpop, Rock n Roll, and Pop, Free the Cynics have created an intense, energetic, eclectic sound all of their own which is delivered with searing passion, ballsy swagger and red-hot intensity onstage. Despite receiving rave reviews on both sides of the pond for their debut record 'Showtunes From the Basement' and 2017's 'Post-Iconica', Free the Cynics come into their own onstage. \r\n\r\n''Free the Cynic’s sensational new six-song EP Post-Iconica...it’s a huge, swaggering thing of melodic-rock beauty that never seems to question its purpose or path.' - \r\nMike Bell, YYScene\r\n\r\n‘Free the Cynics’ new release ‘Post-Iconica’ bursts with blazing energy and artful precision' - Brad Simm, Beatroute\r\n\r\n'9.5/10, sort of a mashup between Modest Mouse and Light Grenades-era Incubus. This is a really great record and I’m happy to have found a contender for my end of the year top ten list' - Syd Ghan, Bucketlist\r\n\r\n'Throwing the rule book out the window, the Calgary four-piece creates a dominating, distinct sound of their own. Rock n’ roll, alt-rock and blues are the discernible genres on the release, a six-track that bleeds hints of jazz and beyond. Jangly guitar riffs, lead singer Rich Paxton’s turbulent but tamed vocals, a song inspired by a menial work position—'Post-Iconica' is as wonderful as it is eclectic. Creating electric rhythms that have listeners captured to each note is not an easy feat, from the dreamy “Wine & Debris” to the rough-edged “Let it Burn.” - The Permanent Press	["music"]	[]	18-40, Uni Students, UK-influenced	\N	Rich Paxton	587-893-2824	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1539803682/artist/592/cover_photo.jpg	2018-07-25 17:56:00.245+00	2019-03-09 05:28:33.52+00	22nd October - Ol' Beautiful Brewery w/The Wet Secrets, All Hands on Jane, Sea Moya, mountain Sound Brigade\r\n24th November - Dickens, Distress Centre Fundraiser w/The Ashley Hundred, The Northern Coast, Betaboys, In Search of Sasquatch\r\nJan 24-27 Venue tbc\r\nApril/May 2019 - Canadian Tour/Festival Date(s)	[{"name":"The Marquee, Calgary","date":"2018/09"},{"name":"Whelan's, Dublin (Sat Night Headline) ","date":"2016/01"},{"name":"SAIT, Calgary","date":"2018/04"}]	[{"index":0,"publicId":"artist/592/hi-res/0.jpg","version":1532541471},{"index":1,"publicId":"artist/592/hi-res/1.jpg","version":1532541490},{"index":2,"publicId":"artist/592/hi-res/2.jpg","version":1532541586}]	[{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/freethecynics"},{"mediaType":"twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/Freethecynics"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/freethecynics"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"https://www.freethecynics.com/"},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://freethecynics.bandcamp.com/track/howlin-barbs","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"1453876099"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://freethecynics.bandcamp.com/album/post-iconica","metadata":{"type":"album","id":"295543764"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://freethecynics.bandcamp.com/track/save-a-little-piece-for-me","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"1696671794"}},{"mediaType":"embeddedYoutube","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b04h0-WXDk8"}]	Fresh from touring with Austin’s Black Pistol Fire, a UK/Ireland tour, and supporting Electric 6, 2018 has been good to FtC.

657	 We’re a wild, sweaty, rock n' roll trio from Moose Jaw, Sk.  Old school, blues based, rock n roll worship with all the showmanship to go with it.  We put on a hell of a show!\r\n\r\nWe've been a band since 2011.  We've toured from Vancouver to Quebec City 4 times over the past two and a half years.  Featured in Vice Magazine a couple times.  We have 5 albums and will be releasing our 6th, Time Child, in October 2018, which was produced by Toronto's Ian Blurton.\r\n\r\nWe've shared the stage with The Dudes, The Pack AD, Megan Nash, B.A. Johnston, Moon Tan, Daniel Romano,  Public Animal, The Electric Revival, Fred Penner, The Wooden Sky, just to name a few!\r\n\r\nTHE TALE OF JOHNNY 2 FINGERS\r\n\r\nBorn at a very young age, John Dale was raised by loving middle-class parents; he grew up in the middle of the Canadian prairies with all the privileges one could ask for. However, John was born with a hideous physical mutation that science could never explain. He was picked on and ridiculed endlessly while growing up, eventually turning to the friendship of insects, snakes, and cartoons.\r\n\r\nDuring his teenage years, he developed a taste for professional wrestling and rock n roll. Realizing he could never be the great wrestler he envisioned, he picked up the guitar. Unfortunately, John's ego spiraled out of control, He began making boisterous and outlandish comments; claiming he was the voice of the unloved and forgotten... Claiming he was a hero... a humanitarian...\r\n\r\nWell, John's selfish intentions became all too apparent. He developed a serious addiction to vegan recipes and online video games; becoming increasingly aggressive. He hired a duo of goons (consisting of former pro wrestler, Cannonball Kelly, on drums and the space child, Tangean Travis Geib, on bass) dubbed 'The Deformities' to do his bidding. John was just another good apple turned bad; feeling like the world wronged him and it had a little splainin' to do. He vowed to teach society a lesson, one gig at a time... Johnny 2 Fingers was born.\r\n\r\n	["music"]	[]	\N	\N	John Dale	3066314413	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1534221280/artist/657/cover_photo.jpg	2018-08-14 04:32:08.265+00	2019-03-09 05:28:33.548+00	\N	\N	[{"index":0,"publicId":"artist/657/hi-res/0.jpg","version":1534221348},{"index":1,"publicId":"artist/657/hi-res/1.jpg","version":1534221414},{"index":2,"publicId":"artist/657/hi-res/2.jpg","version":1534221451}]	[{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/johnny2fingersandthedeformities"},{"mediaType":"twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/johnny2fingers0"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/johnny2fingers0"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"http://johnny2fingers.com"},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://johnny2fingers.bandcamp.com/track/king-of-the-underground","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"3045180304"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://johnny2fingers.bandcamp.com/track/built-to-rock-n-roll","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"1310409583"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://johnny2fingers.bandcamp.com/track/govern-yourself","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"557072625"}},{"mediaType":"embeddedYoutube","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVlTClcpPPs&list=PLk0bGvjX4yuVcP9WpLal4AfGoD97QNjTf"}]	"Moose Jaw's finest is living proof that we're now living in an alternate timeline - one where live music with conventional instruments can still change your night & blow your brains." 	rock	["blues","punk"]	originals	\N	pVlTClcpPPs	\N	\N	\N

1710	On his new album Lonesome Stretch Of Highway, Mike Plume is reborn. Its nine tracks bear the Edmonton singer/songwriter’s distinctive mark, but with an added crackling energy that’s a byproduct of hard-won experience.\r\n\r\nHaving first arrived on the scene in the midst of the alt-country insurgency of the early 1990s, Plume and his loyal band have logged countless miles around the globe, touring with the likes of Steve Earle, The Mavericks, John Hiatt and others, while befriending legends such as Levon Helm and Stompin’ Tom Connors. The lessons he’s learned along the way have left an indelible mark on Lonesome Stretch Of Highway, with songs such as “Younger Than We Are Today,” “It’s A Long Way” (featuring The Road Hammers), and “Perfume And Gasoline” destined to take a place among his best-loved tunes.\r\n\r\nPlume has long been known for his richly detailed storytelling style and unyielding devotion to rock and roll’s original spirit. That’s all present on Lonesome Stretch Of Highway, powered by Plume’s earthy, uncompromising voice. That combination is proof that one of Canada’s most accomplished singer/songwriters remains at the top of his game and is ready to hit that highway again.

616	Taking inspiration from all forms of music, the style of Desperado Pilots comes from a blend of various and, at times, polarized influences; all filtered through the unique voice of Philip Beaton and the wet, distorted guitar tones that he grew up with. Idolizing the great modern rock bands of our time like Queens of the Stone Age, Arctic Monkeys, and Muse, this is a band that finds rock music at it's best when it has one foot in the fringe and one in the mainstream. \r\n\r\nThey hit that mark with their debut EP "EL(EP)HANT", a three-song romp through the serene, the abrasive, and the groovy. Slightly tongue-in-cheek lyrics, with strange imagery and messages of hope in times of despair, will lead you through massive walls of electric guitars, smooth bass, and thunderous drums.\r\n\r\nDesperado Pilots released their latest single, “Bon Voyage” in August 2017. The song garnered the band international attention, making its way onto Mike Ziemer’s “Unsigned Spotlight” Spotify playlist and rotation on Viral with Candice Marshall on Limehead Radio UK. These milestones have propelled the band into a creative storm that has their next release written and ready to record.

648	National fencing champion Ross Monteith and orchestra nerd Calvin Langman didn't exactly get along in high school. However, a chance conversation in 2014 about the success of Youtube cover bands brought the two together to pave a road to quick fortune. Their mix of rocking guitars and electric cello created a unique dynamic, blending their love of rock artists like The Black Keys and folk bands like The Violent Femmes. The resulting music produced a youthful and chaotic frenzy of catchy melodies and raw instrumentals. When the band recruited professional gamer Luke Davis to join the band on drums, The Happy Fits were born. The band's first single "While You Fade Away" from their debut EP "Awfully Apeelin'" reached #5 on Spotify's Top 50 Viral USA Chart the first week of its release.

681	A Day as Wolves is the brainchild of brothers Andrew and Kyle Eskesen. Based in Calgary Alberta, A Day as Wolves initially stemmed from writing sessions Andrew and Kyle had to pass the time in endless Alberta winters. Their twangy undertones, fuzzed out guitar riffs, and heavy drums combined with soulful vocals about love, women, and drunken nights create the blues rock sound that is A Day as Wolves. In 2014, A Day as Wolves won the coveted X 929.9 Xposure Contest that gave the group radio play, a slot at 2014’s X-Fest (featuring Jack White, Artic Monkeys, Cage the Elephant, July Talk, Tegan and Sara, and many more), and gained national attention which ultimately lead to numerous shows across Canada to date. The self-titled debut LP gained the band momentum and title track "Move To Be Free" has been featured on radio playlists, blogs, magazines, and advertising all over the world. With a new fire lit inside each of the members, A Day as Wolves looks to continue their success in 2018 with new music, major show announcements, and tour dates	["music"]	[]	\N	\N	Andrew Eskesen	4038639889	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1535140606/artist/681/cover_photo.jpg	2018-08-24 19:54:26.493+00	2019-03-09 05:28:33.555+00	\N	\N	[]	[{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/adayaswolves/"},{"mediaType":"twitter","url":"https://www.twitter.com/ADAWmusic"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/ADayAsWolves"},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://adayaswolves.bandcamp.com/track/move-to-be-free-3","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"3877575219"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://adayaswolves.bandcamp.com/track/my-centerfold","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"212351685"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://adayaswolves.bandcamp.com/track/broken-heart-city-2","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"2561116499"}},{"mediaType":"youtubeChannel","url":"https://www.youtube.com/user/ADayAsWolves"}]	Alberta Beer Soaked Rock N Roll	rock	["roots"]	originals	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

713	The Story\r\n\r\nExtroverts formed in 1979 in Regina, Saskatchewan, far away from any of the happening urban punk scenes. \r\nCrazy fun house parties, then DIY hall gigs, then nightclubs and touring throughout the prairies, including two extended stays at the legendary Calgarian Hotel. Released one 7” single in 1980, “Living in Poverty/Political Animals”. \r\n\r\nDespite writing over 50 songs in two and a half years, Extroverts disbanded before recording a full-length album.\r\nBand members Brent Caron, Eddie Lester, Grant McDonald and Hap Hazard went their separate ways, but remained pals. In 2009, the band reformed with all original members, and live shows revealed that Extroverts songs still had the same high energy, and band members were still able to deliver these songs in tight, fun, energetic sets. \r\n\r\nThe Comeback Album\r\n\r\nTwelve songs with unused lyrics from 1979 and brand new music were included on the Extroverts’ first-ever album, SUPPLE, which was released in late 2016. Extroverts toured across Canada in 2016-2017. \r\n\r\nExtroverts music is firmly rooted in 1970’s UK punk/US New Wave, and they regard the UK as their spiritual musical home. The band was approved by Stiff Little Fingers to open for them during SLF’s most recent Canadian tour.\r\n\r\n2019 marks 40 years since the Extroverts formed, and there will be a lot going on: new album, vinyl re-issues from labels in Madrid and Victoria, and lots of shows to celebrate this milestone.\r\n	["music"]	[]	\N	\N	Les Holmlund	3065293524	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1536360855/artist/713/cover_photo.jpg	2018-09-07 22:46:05.112+00	2019-03-09 05:28:33.566+00	\N	\N	[{"index":0,"publicId":"artist/713/hi-res/0.jpg","version":1536360915},{"index":1,"publicId":"artist/713/hi-res/1.jpg","version":1536360940},{"index":2,"publicId":"artist/713/hi-res/2.jpg","version":1536361029}]	[{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/TheExtroverts/"},{"mediaType":"twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/Extroverts_CAN"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/theextroverts/"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"http://www.theextroverts.com"},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://extroverts.bandcamp.com/track/marilyn-monroes-eyes","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"1321370690"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://extroverts.bandcamp.com/track/new-york-circles","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"3888286086"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://extroverts.bandcamp.com/track/brave-new-world-2","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"4234544523"}},{"mediaType":"youtubeChannel","url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7G9i4eO2lxKpk76KaI_bew"}]	The Extroverts formed in Regina in 1979, and still bring fans to their feet with high-energy, fun live shows.

794	By combining pull-no-punches power with whole hearted sing-alongs, Calgary four-piece indie bad boys In Search of Sasquatch have crafted a sound that’s all their own since their 2012 inception. Consisting of middle school friends Shane Andrews, Nick Pichonsky, Connor Burrows, and Nathan Kunz, the group pulls influence from across the board, ranging from the indie “wall of sound” attacks made popular by aughties heroes Arctic Monkeys and The Strokes, to lyrical wordplay and references inspired by 90’s hip hop legends A Tribe Called Quest. The band’s self-titled EP hit the front page of iTunes in 2015, and their follow-up single “South Migration” found steady radio play on Calgary’s X92.9 Exposure program. The band’s latest EP, Later Days, was released in January 2018 and is available on Spotify, Apple Music, iTunes, Bandcamp, and more.

647	Singer-songwriter Norine Braun has been cleverly crafting and honing her wise and confident musicianship with 10 independently released albums to her credit. This Canadian artist bridges the gap between singer/songwriter and a rock-and-roll performer. Blending timeless elements such as roots rock, blues, soul, jazz and country, Braun presents these genres to audiences around the nation with a bold freshness. With comparisons to Joni Mitchell, kd lang, and Patti Smith, Braun’s eclectic approach to songwriting and heartfelt performance techniques are the fundamentals of her solid reputation with her local music scene and beyond. She has received recognition from events such as the LA Music Awards, The Best Female Musicians magazine and the winner of the international songwriting competition Artists Inspired By Literature.\r\nIn 2016 Norine Braun released her 10th full- length album to critical acclaim, including a Canada Council For The Arts award and is nominated for a 2018 Western Canadian Music Award. A masterful body of creative work titled "Gone To The Spirits" is based on the engaging and dramatic life story of  a Two Spirit, Ktunaxa prophet, messenger, chief and guide. Gone- To-The-Spirits lived in the early and mid-19th century in what is now known as southeastern BC, Canada and appeared in the journals of explorers and fur traders of the time period. This was followed by Braun’s Riding The Rails tour across Canada by train as the Via Rail on board artist last fall. The tour went from Vancouver to Toronto and Toronto to Halifax via Ottawa, Quebec City and Montreal with shows in each city. Following the tour Norine was awarded a scholarship to attend the Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity as Musician in Residence November and December 2017 where she began synthesizing her train experience and the writing of her compositions and lyrics for her upcoming album based on her train tour. Norine is currently in studio recording this new album set to release November 2018.

659	Hailing from Calgary, Alberta, The Evergreen Standard is comprised of 4 friends playing music together for the sake of creating something fun, exciting, and refreshing. The members of The Evergreen Standard grew up all over Canada from the West to East coast, yet quickly recognized that they all had very similar upbringings and musical influences. Two of the members are educators by trade and feel that it is important to share Canadian history through music and lyrics. The resulting product is a style of music that has a very Canadian vibe.\r\nOriginally formed in 2014, The Evergreen Standard started as an indie-style rock band, playing regularly in Calgary and southern Alberta.  Recently, The Evergreen Standard has honed their craft into a catchy, poppy, yet aggressive alternative punk sound with elements of 1990’s emo.

2056	Bryan Hansen Band is an award-winning 'blue eyed funk' band located in New Jersey. Members include William Blakey on Bass Guitar & Vocals, Cwan Merritt (Q) on Drums.\r\n\r\nBryan Hansen Band averages 125-160 gigs per year, performing at notable venues all through the East and West Coasts, including Winter NAMM 2020, House of Blues Anaheim, The Troubadour in WEHO, So Far Sounds NYC & DC, Asbury Lanes, The Wonder Bar, The Saint, Asbury Hotel, Laundromat Bar Morristown, Hamilton Stage at UCPAC, Maplewood Stock, Bowery Electric, West End Lounge and Cava Winery in Hamburg, NJ.  \r\n\r\nBryan Hansen Band's sound is a mix of funk, rock, soul and R&B with music influences from Stevie Wonder, Dave Matthews Band, John Mayer, Al Green and Victor Wooten. They're proudly endorsed by Godin Guitars & BG France.\r\n\r\nSinger songwriter Bryan Hansen has been performing since the age of 15. He learned how to play the guitar at 11 when his father re-strung his Fender Stratocaster that had been collecting dust under the bed for over 10 years. In 2009, Hansen recorded his first solo EP called "Ebb & Flow." Produced by Sean Baker in Hansen's home studio, 'Ebb & Flow' was a concept record about a relationship from beginning to end.\r\n\r\nBryan Hansen's first full length album, Brothers Among Wolves was released in August 2013. The album was produced by Stephen Kaminski and featured 18 different musicians from the Tri-State Area. In Fall 2013, after performing over 85 shows with the studio musicians from Brothers Among Wolves, Hansen paired up with musicians William Blakey & Cwan Merritt to perform with him as the Bryan Hansen Band. This created the shift from singer-songwriter to funk power trio. \r\n\r\nFall 2016 Bryan Hansen Band released its sophomore record 'When You Stop Pulling Back.' Featuring singles "Tasteless," and "Tug Of War." On September 24th, 2016 the band played a sold out performance at the Union County Performing Arts Center Hamilton Stage with opener Kim Boyko. The album is a dedication to Bryan's late father. \r\n\r\nWBLS own Lenny Green featured the group on a live broadcast from Milk River in Brooklyn NY, coining the phrase "blue eyed soul," to explain the bands unique sound.  \r\n\r\nIn 2018, just weeks before heading into the studio to record their third LP, Bryan Hansen Band was struck with the devastating news that their keyboardist and brother, Hank Rosenthal had passed away tragically from a heroin overdose. Emotions ran high and they stepped into the studio to record 'Gas Money,' in honor of Hank. Gas Money was released in October 2019, featuring 8 new songs featuring singles "Diamonds," "Smiling Dashboard Jesus," and "Waiting for Tomorrow." In 2019, Bryan Hansen Band was featured as WRAT's NJ Rock Band of the Week. \r\n\r\nThe record opens with the hook, "Even the dark will not be dark to you. The dark will shine like the day, for the dark is a light to you." Their album release show at The Asbury Lanes in Asbury Park, New Jersey helped to raise over $1,000 for Rutgers Recovery House in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Bryan Hansen Band continues to help fight the battle against the opioid crisis by helping to educate their fans on how they can make a difference in their community. \r\n\r\n2020 couldn't have started off stronger for the Bryan Hansen Band. They were featured at Winter NAMM in Anaheim California, House of Blues Anaheim and got the opportunity to open for 7Horse at The Troubadour in West Hollywood. Returning home with the anticipation of a national tour, 2020 had other plans. The Bryan Hansen Band made the most of the situation by providing live streams to their fans and helping charities through virtual fundraisers for Inroads to Opportunities, JCC of Central NJ, NAACP Legal Defense Fund and helping feed frontline workers at various medical centers on both the east and west coast. \r\n\r\nIn November 2020, Bryan Hansen Band teamed up with singer songwriter Kim Boyko to re-imagine the 80's holiday hit, "Christmas Wrapping," by The Waitresses, except the 2020 pandemic version. The video sparked viral success on TikTok, viewed by 113K people on the Bravo Confessionals page. Songwriter Chris Butler commented that the video was "BRILLIANT," thanking the band by sharing it on his personal page for fans around the world. \r\n\r\nBryan Hansen Band is in pre-production for their fifth studio album to be released in Summer 2022. \r\n\r\n"We have a saying in the band that Q came up with, 'Make it Do What It Do.' It's our mantra. Gets us through the rehearsals until midnight, performances, 6 hour recording sessions and pushes us to do what it takes to get through the day." -Bryan, Will & Q.

1378	River Poets is a folk-rock musical duo featuring the Johnson brothers, Jo and Cabel Johnson. They have been writing, recording and performing Canadian-inspired songs and a large catalogue of covers for the last number of years.\r\nGrowing up along the banks of the Saskatchewan River near the outskirts of The Pas, Manitoba in the rural community of Rall's Island, the Johnson brothers felt the lure of music at an early age. With the stereo humming in the house (and car), blasting music both new and old, usually mailed from friends that lived in the big city, and mom's guitar and piano and Dad's banjo always within reach, it didn't take long for a lifelong love of music to take hold. Music provided--and continues to provide--family, friends and strangers moments to get lost in and be a part of together. \r\nRiver Poets draw their inspiration from the Canadian landscape and its people. From the Pacific coast along to the Rocky Mountains, feeding into the North and South Saskatchewan Rivers. Ripping north to the tundra and permafrost of the Territories, the Northwest wind bringing us back past prairie highways of beaming canola, tawny wheat and broken-blue flax. The Great Lakes. The resonant and varied history of Canada’s Indigenous peoples, Pre-Confederation Canada in New France and Old York. And the rich, vibrant Atlantic Canadian provinces with salt on-the-air, golden-era boats in the water and bright red mud lining its fertile soil. \r\nRiver Poets started out playing open-mic nights and busking in Leduc, Alberta. They entered a songwriting contest (Rock the Block) through Main Street Leduc and were one of the 10 finalists to perform at the Grand Opening of Main Street on June 24th 2017. Soon, gigs began cropping up over the next two years through a variety of contacts in Leduc, including: Leduc Arts Foundry Art Walk, Fourth Friday Downtown Leduc Block Party, Black Gold Rodeo, and other local events. Jonathan’s Lounge also began hiring River Poets for monthly gigs in the fall of 2018 through the spring of 2019. Most recently, River Poets was hired for the O’Brian’s Restaurant and Grill - Urban Farmer’s Market and Culture Days through the City of Leduc during the fall of 2019.\r\nRiver Poets writes songs for all Canadians; with a focus on referencing provinces and territories, cities and small towns, while including historical references and local/national vernacular. Canada’s history, land, and people with their encompassing stories drive and shape these songs. River Poets began recording an EP in the summer of 2019. The tracks on the EP are inspired by and/or reference: a metaphor for the hardships the Indigenous peoples in Canada endured and continue to endure by staying connected to the land (River Poets); The Painted Door by Sinclair Ross (Prairie Disaster); spending a night out in the snow with your love--even if they are a wreck (Shadows of the Rain); family, friends and Cranberry Portage, MB (Canneberge); driving home across the provinces and seasons (Darling Allison); and meeting the woman of your dreams while working at a small town grocery store while (vernacular) “birling hard in pits of sand” (Harder Stuff). They hope to take their self-titled EP to garner more interest through gigging and create a following for their music. Their goal is to record a full-length album, with each track representing a different province and territory for a total of 13 (ten provinces and 3 territories). \r\n	["music"]	[]		\N	Jo Johnson	780-964-4137	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1574828397/artist/1378/cover_photo.jpg	2019-11-19 04:30:02.436+00	2020-10-05 16:38:55.155+00	Edmonton and Area: all evenings; anytime on weekends\r\nCalgary and Area: Saturdays	[{"name":"Canada Day 2020 (Virtual Concert) - Shell Theatre ","date":"2020/07"},{"name":"Black Gold Rodeo - Main Stage Trade Show","date":"2019/05"},{"name":"Leduc Culture Days ","date":"2019/09"}]	[{"index":0,"publicId":"artist/1378/hi-res/0.jpg","version":1574828953},{"index":1,"publicId":"artist/1378/hi-res/1.jpg","version":1574828964},{"index":2,"publicId":"artist/1378/hi-res/2.jpg","version":1574828973}]	[{"mediaType":"embeddedYoutube","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ma3NBuqmljI"},{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://facebook.com/riverpoetsband"},{"mediaType":"twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/PoetsRiver"},{"mediaType":"youtubeChannel","url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk7K1XQK38eoz0RBvsAU5Zw"},{"mediaType":"spotify","url":"https://open.spotify.com/album/0mS2R6i5Xp0XgxPFSMAS1h"},{"mediaType":"bandcampArtist","url":"https://riverpoets.bandcamp.com/"},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"http://riverpoets.bandcamp.com/track/river-poets-sample","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"1848152062"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"http://riverpoets.bandcamp.com/track/canneberge-sample","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"1472373333"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"http://riverpoets.bandcamp.com/track/harder-stuff-sample","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"2604748779"}}]	River Poets are a Canadian duo that built their foundations in the heritage and traditions of their Canadian homeland--bringing it to light through their own brand of Canadianity folk-rock.\r\n	folk	["singer-songwriter"]	originals	\N	ma3NBuqmljI	\N	\N	\N
232	Yes, my name is Stephen King. Based in Calgary since 1988, originally from the Maritimes, I’m a multi-instrumentalist but have been a guitar player and singer/songwriter for a long time, mixing many genres. Currently focusing on my guitar slinging, background singing, and harp playing with our band Memphis & The Grande. Go here for all my links (websites, music streaming, social, etc...):\r\n\r\nhttps://tap.bio/@stephenkingerking\r\nhttps://tap.bio/@memphisandthegrande\r\n\r\nWhen doing a solo show at a cafe for e.g., I try to play a mixture of original/cover tunes ... depending on gig and how the audience flows ... in a variety of musical genres and styles. Which is why I describe my sets as “Americana.”  Having studied so many different musical styles for so long, it's all kinda of morphed and squished together in my current playing approach. I continue to be humbled by the journey of music! On any given night you'll see me playing acoustic guitar, harmonica, one string diddley bow, ukelele, Fender strat, dobro, Gibson es-175td, and even a guitar synth etc... depending on the feelz. \r\n\r\nI also play bass, drums, a bit of keyboards / accordian and stretching into stringed instruments like ukeleles & charangas. I have 6 self-produced original CD's from about 25 years of recording. But mostly, I love giving energy to events, bringing people together, and seeing smiles on people's singing faces.\r\n\r\nThanks for readin’ and listenin’\r\n\r\nStephen Kinger King\r\n@stephdokin	["music"]	["alternative","americana","bluegrass","blues","classical","country","folk","jazz","rock","roots","singer-songwriter"]	All ages seem to enjoy hanging out when we're playing ... sometimes lots of sing-a-longs too.

664	Samantha Savage Smith is a singer, songwriter, and musician from Calgary who deals in glistening nuggets of pop song craft, confessional yet subtly playful lyrical themes, and an evolving vision of musical dressingsthat recall choice bits of Roxy Music, Angel Olsen, and Land of Talk. The new albumFake Nice is a shimmering collection of multi-hued songs brought to life by Smith and co-producer Chris Dadge (Alvvays, Chad Van Gaalen), alongside guests such as Scott Munro (Preoccupations), Ryan Bourne(Ghostkeeper), and Edmonton’s Marlaena Moore.While the album is once again centred around her show-stopping vocals and unique brand of songwriting, Fake Nice reveals an even more personalized and uncompromising vision of what a Samantha Savage Smith album can be, which ultimately is a result of her digging further into the production process, getting her hands dirtier than ever before. This extends all the way from penning the bulk of the material on the record, to racking up more instrumental credits than ever and getting deep into the mixing process –there is nothing on this album that shouldn’t be there.Her live band is comprised of the cream of Calgary’s ever-ripe music community (including members of Polydactic, Sunglaciers & Lab Coast) and have shared stages with the likes of Cate Le Bon, M Ward, Hayden, Couer de Pirate, and Basia Bulat. Fake Nice is slated for release April 22nd 2022 on Saved By Vinyl, and will be available everywhere that you find good music	["music"]	[]		\N		5878882520	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1594504669/artist/664/cover_photo.jpg	2018-08-16 18:58:56.867+00	2022-01-20 22:58:29.786+00	\N	[]	[{"index":0,"publicId":"artist/664/hi-res/0.jpg","version":1594505166},{"index":1,"publicId":"artist/664/hi-res/1.jpg","version":1594505351}]	[{"mediaType":"embeddedYoutube","url":"https://youtu.be/N_LvGfVgLfs"},{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://facebook.com/Samantha.Savage.Smith"},{"mediaType":"twitter","url":"http://twitter.com/samsavsmith"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"http://www.instagram.com/samsavsmith"},{"mediaType":"youtubeChannel","url":"https://youtube.com/channel/UCjJkfXCJ_DQpe3JOsjdGZTw"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"https://www.samanthasavagesmith.ca/"},{"mediaType":"spotify","url":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/2RBwFphGPWgoziqyKVmb41?si=HmhzynW_T9yC09pELc5P3A"},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://samanthasavagesmith.bandcamp.com/album/fine-lines","metadata":{"type":"album","id":"866635710"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://sledisland.bandcamp.com/track/siren","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"2265338896"}}]	Singer, Songwriter, Guitar Player, Sass Pants	singer-songwriter	["indie-rock"]	originals	\N	N_LvGfVgLfs	\N	\N	\N

If you come close enough to the stage you can feel Cory’s metal roots pounding out of bass amp, and last but not least there’s Jesse. He probably has the hardest job, trying to bridge the genres with percussion. Going from a swing groove, to a 3/4, to a straight up 4/4 pop punk groove. If your anywhere within throwing distance you can bet you’ll hear him belting out lyrics.

1265	Eunice Keitan's soulful voice makes a big impression on listeners. Both her international upbringing and her eclectic music background show in this Canadian singer-songwriter's work which mixes R&B, Jazz, and World Folk influences.  While traveling and moving often with her family in simple circumstances throughout her childhood, Eunice noticed the everyday people and their often harsh realities, struggles which impacted her perception of social issues at play in the lives of people around the world. That impact surfaces in the themes of many of her songs, where she explores mental health, addiction, abuse, and social change. \r\nEunice was nominated for a Toronto Independent Music Award 'Where The Road Begins' from her last EP. The first single “Hope is a bird” from her new EP will be released on September 10, Suicide Prevention Day. “Hope is a bird” brings into the open her dealing with depression and finding hope again in community.\r\n	["music"]	[]	\N	\N	Julian Bustos	6477836967	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1565557040/artist/1265/cover_photo.jpg	2019-08-11 20:56:50.908+00	2019-08-11 20:59:57.511+00	\N	\N	[{"index":0,"publicId":"artist/1265/hi-res/0.jpg","version":1565557196}]	[{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/eunicekeitan/"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/eunicekeitan"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"http://www.eunice-keitan.com"},{"mediaType":"youtubeChannel","url":"https://www.youtube.com/ekeitan"},{"mediaType":"embeddedYoutube","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObAAiIukRNk"},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://eunicekeitan.bandcamp.com/track/donde-estas","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"618544358"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://eunicekeitan.bandcamp.com/track/where-the-road-begins","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"4179733584"}}]	"The eclecticism of this artist’s sound will leave you craving more of her soothing voice" - Ride The Tempo	singer-songwriter	["folk","jazz"]	originals	\N	ObAAiIukRNk	\N	\N	\N

241	With a mix of original music - including the EP 'Snapshot Blues' released in June 2019 - and classic blues, jazz and rock & roll, Neil performs throughout Calgary and area. His songs feature 'Cool Blues' and jazz-based singer/songwriter styles. Dave Brubeck, Jimi Hendrix and Bruce Cockburn are some of Neil's main influences. An entertaining and experienced performer, Neil combines impressive guitar playing with witty and touching lyrics born of a past life as a journalist. The range of music, depending on the venue and audience, ranges from classic jazz to down and dirty blues to contemporary acoustic guitar tunes.  He has three CDs as well as many singles released for original tunes and also draws on classic blues and jazz tunes - as well as a bit of R&B and Rock & Roll. I do a range of instrumental music as well, including tunes from my instrumental CD September Winds and various jazz tunes. Typically performs solo but can bring drums and bass depending on the venue and budget.

1303	Kristin Grace was born and raised in Alberta. Growing up she had a love of storytelling and country music, which encouraged her to pick up the guitar when she was 12. She has her heart set on one goal: being a joy and light to those around her.  In recent years, she has found that she could fulfill that goal through music. In the spring, she was a finalist at the Ship and Anchor youth songwriting contest and won best performance. Her highlight of this year was being a finalist in the BVJ Horizon Talent Stage performing only original music. Back in mid August, she received runner-up in the Vegreville Country 106 Star Search.

596	Shuffalo began in early 2018 when Brayden Bell, then a singer-songwriter, and longtime collaborator Steve MacDonald met drummer Mac Bennett and they immediately connected. Soon after they brought in Bailey Clarke to fill out the ensemble. Inspired, they put out their debut EP Heart Attack within months of forming with producer Will MacLellan (Raleigh). After gaining local attention, they became a part of the Soaring Eagle Records family.\r\n\r\nA year under their belt, the band continues to grow with each other, and the focused energy within their live performances has inspired a new set of warm and melody driven songs. Shuffalo brings the soul out of natural spaces, shaped by the bands harmonies and spare vocals of frontman and fire-heart Brayden Bell, whose serene vocal melodies and naturalistic performances enact the mountain shapes that preoccupy his empathetic lyrics.

1523	It's the sounds of honestly and hard work, a particularly Albertan brand of honest heartfelt songwriting that finds its roots in Blues, Folk, and Classic Rock and Roll.\r\n\r\nJay Bowcott currently resides in Calgary, Alberta. He has been hard at it in the music scene for over 10 years touring Canada a number of times over the years and slugging out a living with his guitar within Alberta. He has been considered one of Alberta's hardest working musicians with between three to five gigs a week for the past few years. \r\n\r\nJay's following has been growing in the last couple years with a considerable amount of solo performances as well as debuting his new band "Rooks" who are slated to release a new 8 song album this spring. He has worked in the past with producer Leeroy Stagger on two albums, Enslow's Drifters and his solo album Morning Sky Blues. He has had supporting slots with artists, Ed Kowalczyk (of Live), and Glass Tiger. As well as headlining a number of gigs across Southern Alberta at countless venues. \r\n\r\n A hardworking musician that won't quit and it shows in his music. The growth over the previous few years has been exponential. He has also offered up a tribute performance dedicated to the likes of Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger, which expanded his musical knowledge and helped mature his own songwriting into what it is today.\r\n\r\nListeners find themselves involved in the honest approach and deeply personal lyrics. A strong vocal performance backed by solid guitar work that is the result of gruelling rehearsal time and immense dedication to his craft. The hard work and belief in his art are what keep him moving forward and progressing in a forever changing and relentless industry.

1628	Ah, yacht pop – buoyant, bright, conjuring cocktails, dancing, kaleidoscopic colours, windswept, sun-bleached days and simple bliss. This is where Calgary’s Kayla Williams has been fashioning her nostalgic home, paying homage to the smooth feel-good stylings of yacht rock royalty like TOTO, Steely Dan, Hall & Oats and The Doobie Brothers. With soulfully dynamic vocals and contemporary production flair, she flips the script by packing a poppy punch, old soul wisdom and a bold feminine perspective, giving the male-dominated genre some much needed sparkle and spice.\r\n\r\nWilliams’ summer 2023 EP RETRODELIA, is a positivity-forward throwback tribute with a twist! Inspired by playful, lighthearted horn-blasting mid ‘70s tunes and their funky earworm hooks, harmonies and bass-driven grooves. Its title speaks to the EP’s retro spirit and fearless femininity and with Beach Boy Brian Wilson’s official approval (“You’ve got the voice!”), the yacht pop songstress embraces that gift, bringing vibrant, glittery energy to the retro sound.

952	Chris Strei is a country singer/songwriter whose style has been compared with Chris Stapleton and Bob Dylan. Chris draws on his own life experiences for inspiration in his music. With compositions influenced by blues, bluegrass and also some elements of hard rock and metal, Chris's songs tell stories with a relatable point of view. It's fair to say he's not the only one who deals with these situations and themes. Since the end of 2017, Chris has come a long way in a short time: Following an opportunity to open for the Juno-nominated band The Trews in December, he embraced a philosophy that you miss 100% of the shots you don't take. In June 2018, Chris embarked on his first cross-Canada BlackBird Tour from Ontario to Alberta with a return trip to Alberta in June 2019; he accepted an opportunity to perform alongside Juno-nominated folk and pop singer Dayna Manning in August; and in September he cracked the Top 25 in The Shot, Canada's Premiere Singing Competition. Chris has also been blessed with appearances at Canadian Music Week, Hugh's Room Live, became a staple in the final 5 years of Canterbury Folk Fest in Ingersoll.\r\n\r\nIn July 2019, Chris released his full-length album, "The Moonshine" (produced by Iain McNally and mixed by Paul Intson and Iain McNally) to a sold out venue at Riffs Music Lounge in Woodstock, Ontario. Featuring Iain McNally on guitars, keys, percussion, banjo, tres, and mandolin, Rick Roach on drums as well as backup vocals with Jay Riehl and Janna Leduc of Thorn and Roses, Paul Intson on upright bass, Steve O'Connor on keys. The Moonshine is a collection of 10 dynamic songs that touch on various topics and styles, from the sweet commitment of "Love You Anyhow," to the date-night glow of a dashboard light on the title's title track "Moonshine", the bittersweet goodbye of "Timbercreek", and the gritty, fan-favourite "Prison Bound Man". \r\n\r\n"The Moonshine" is available on ChrisStrei.com!

Armed with her unique guitar playing style and a silky voice, she adapts her performance to suit the crowd in the moment.

1164	David Unsworth is a 22-year-old singer-songwriter based out of Edmonton, Alberta. \r\n\r\nDavid has played at festivals such as: the Canmore Folk Festival, Edmonton International Fringe Festival and Edmonton's Found Festival. He is also an official busker at Edmonton's City Market Downtown. His debut EP: Wait was recorded and released in early 2015 and has been played on local radio stations CKUA and CJSR. Currently, David is busking, gigging and going to open mics around Edmonton, and has recently completed his Bachelor's in Jazz and Contemporary Music at Macewan University.\r\n\r\nDavid's musical journey began in choral music. From a young age David sang in a number of children's and youth choirs, slowly gaining an appreciation for choral music, while simultaneously marveling in more contemporary artists of the late 20th century like Queen and Midnight Oil.  After several years of guitar lessons David turned his attention to composition, and began writing songs in 2013. Soon David started playing at open mics and busking at local farmers markets, learning to use a loop pedal in live situations to create a full band sound with just vocals and a guitar. As his performances began to develop their own style, so did David's songwriting, taking and blending Alternative Rock with Folk and Pop music.

1539	Edmonton-based singer/songwriter Jessica Heine's dynamic voice shakes rooms – she's a classically trained vocal performer, who sings regularly with the award-winning Edmonton choral group, Chronos Vocal Ensemble. But her passion is the power of song, shared through the folk tradition. \r\n\r\nGrowing up in Edson, Alberta, Heine has embraced the Edmonton music scene since relocating there two decades ago. She's nurtured strong connections within the folk community with her start as a regular performer at open mics. Those connections included promoters, radio djs, folk clubs, industry backers and other musicians. In November of 2018 she self-released her third album, Goodbye Party, produced by another Edmonton musical stalwart, Peter Stone of the folk band 100 mile house. That album was the start to a year in which she saw her music propelled into national focus. She signed with record label Fallen Tree Records; gained festival slots at Edmonton, Canmore and Jasper Folk Festivals; and embarked on tours in Ontario, Alberta and BC. \r\n\r\nIt also marked a year in which she melded her folk singing with her classical world. The Edmonton-based choral group Vocal Alchemy invited her to perform two of her new, and at that time unreleased, songs with them. This relationship and these arrangements led to Heine inviting members of both Chronos and Vocal Alchemy to join her during her album release party. The collaboration enriched her music dynamically, and illustrated her broad-appeal while demonstrating her unique musical role. \r\n\r\nGoodbye Party has taken Heine’s stories across North America, through radio play on stations from New York to New Jersey, Florida to California, along with charting on radio stations in Kamloops, Calgary and Edmonton. \r\n\r\nIn March of 2020, as she returned from touring the Pacific Northwest with her vocal group, the pandemic forced her into an isolation that has seen her proliferate and focus her artistic practice. A new album of material, that will break from her previous recording’s fragility, is set to be recorded. \r\n\r\nWith her strong connections, her burgeoning audience and her vocal strength, be prepared to have your emotions shaken up by Jessica Heine. 	["music"]	[]	 Based on social media statistics (Facebook, Twitter and Instagram), email list subscribers, Apple Music and Spotify for Artists data, her largest demographic segment are females aged 35-45 in professional careers, however her appeal is significant across the 25-65+ age-range, with her audience becoming more male as they age.

1080	If "Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans" is a great lyric, it's likely because people relate to it. Kim Gates does. \r\n\r\nA singer and songwriter for many years, Kim kept his songs and singing mostly to himself. When the economy changed in 2014, this oilfield technologist and trainer soon found himself with a new job title (Home Dad), and a need to get out of the house once a week. Playing open stages led to jobs hosting open stages, and later the steady music work he's so thankful for. He is influenced by the writing of Earle, and Joel, and the music of Blue Rodeo and The Tragically Hip. A soulful storyteller, with a slight activist bent, Kim is happiest singing songs about the stories that change our lives.\r\n\r\nhttps://vimeo.com/330275587\r\nIG: @cageygates\r\nFB: @kimgatesmusic 	["music"]	[]		\N	Kim Gates		\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1565662470/artist/1080/cover_photo.jpg	2019-04-21 07:02:10.401+00	2019-09-05 16:15:46.269+00	\N	[{"name":"Duggan's Boundary Edmonton","date":"2019/06"},{"name":"Blowers and Grafton Edmonton","date":"2019/05"},{"name":"The Station Edmonton","date":"2019/01"}]	\N	[{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/kimgatesmusic"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/CageyGates"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"https://vimeo.com/330275587"}]	I like stories.

1690	Twang savant Skinny Dyck has put on weight since his debut LP Get to Know Lonesome (2020) – a delight to fans of traditional country music but in equal measure with an alternative leaning audience.  On first listen, the Lethbridge, Alberta-based singer/songwriter Skinny may sound like a throwback to classic country artists of the 1960s, but get to know him a little better and it’s clear that he’s firmly part of the new generation of artists pushing country forward into the 21st Century. “I think that’s a result of the aesthetic and the sandwiches” relays Dyck in reference to his penchant toward a tape-saturated, mid-fi sonicscape, coupled with sparse arrangements. Led by the success of the twangy indie-rocker Dreamin’, Get to Know Lonesome found an audience for capturing the “distilled spirit of wide-cut country” (Exclaim!) out of a few days with an 8-track machine in his living room.\r\n\r\nSkinny makes strides on his latest EP, Palace Waiting (out September 2022), which includes “In On The Upswing” and “TV Blue,” set to be released as a 7-inch single through Swedish label Sound Asleep Records.  Produced with Billy Horton (Charley Crockett, Theo Lawrence) in Texas, Skinny capitalizes with brevity on Palace Waiting, pouring an equal measure of traditional country and austere country-folk.

1295	Beyond the reach of the Saddle Hills across the raging waters of the Mighty Peace River is where this expedition begins. Like the morning sun, the beginnings of BLB rose up from the East to settle along the western Plain as many have before. It was there in the heart of the Alberta Peace Country that the BLB embarked on their maiden voyage in 2018.\r\nEquipped with their instruments of choice and an unbridled yearning to explore both the world around them and the music within each of them. Telling stories of their travels, broken strings, and broken hearts the BLB encompass a sound spanning genres and generations.\r\nWhile performing with other groups singer- songwriter, Brad Lynch(vocals, guitar, harmonica) and multi-instrumentalist Matt O'Connor (mandolin, fiddle, banjo) crossed paths. It was that chance encounter that gave birth to a brotherhood and a new sound for both artists. With the later addition of Kyle Doucette (lead guitar and banjo), well travelled drummer Dano Laflamme (drums and vocals), and Logan Kennedy (guitar, steel, dobro, keys, vocals) whom Lynch co-wrote and performed with for 4yrs prior.\r\nWhether you're looking for a boot stomping soiree or a heart wrenching story of love, loss and triumph. Brad Lynch Band has all the elements of a group destine to end up on your must see list.

1407	Tanner James comes from a long line of peasant farmers, trail riders, elk hunters, alcoholics and agriculture salesmen; the perfect pedigree for a folk singer.\r\n\r\nHe is one of the last Canadian storytellers, who is proud to carry on the oral storytelling tradition. His songs are about the people he meets and places he’s been.\r\nThey are gut-wrenchingly funny and heartbreakingly confessional. He can move an audience around and make them laugh and cry.\r\n\r\nPunk rock taught him how to Do-It-Yourself, indie rock taught him how to think outside the box, while roots music is where he always knew he would end up. Most of all, Tanner is a songwriter. \r\n\r\nHis list of songwriting accolades is long, including a 1st place win at the Calgary Folk Music Song Contest and a semifinalist in the UK Songwriting Competition.\r\n\r\nTanner completed a musician-in-residence program at the prestigious Banff Centre in late 2015, where he wrote a new collection of songs and performed a number of recital hall shows.\r\n\r\nHis upcoming release, Painted Horses, is a broad-stroke of life in Western Canada. It was recorded at Riverdale Recorders in Edmonton Alberta (Corb Lund and\r\nthe Hurtin’ Albertans, Carolyn Mark)	["music"]	[]		\N	Tanner James Holthe	4032008060	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1576538653/artist/1407/cover_photo.jpg	2019-12-16 23:21:34.512+00	2020-06-12 20:46:16.719+00	Available all day, everyday - thanks to the COVID Recession Special.

2010	The Whitehouse Wind Symphony was founded by conductor emeritus Casey Bork in 1996, and is now under the direction of James P. Sheeley, Jr. Since its founding, the Symphony has grown rapidly, attracting experienced musicians as regular members from all over New Jersey, as well as New York City and eastern Pennsylvania. The group is now comprised of approximately 50 amateur and professional musicians who perform together regularly to enthusiastic audiences throughout Central and Northern New Jersey.\r\n\r\nThe Symphony is dedicated to presenting the best in all varieties of wind band literature, especially pieces written or arranged for bands during the first half of the 20th century, widely recognized as the "Golden Era" of concert bands in America. The Symphony's repertoire also includes popular tunes, Broadway show scores, marches from around the world, and selections written for and exclusively performed by the ensemble. On many occasions, the Symphony has performed selections written expressly for the band by current band members.\r\n\r\nWhitehouse Wind Symphony concerts are developed around a mix of themes that both challenges the audience as well as the players.

789	Miesha & The Spanks are a high octane garage rock duo from Calgary AB, made up of rock n roll matriarch Miesha Louie and her partner in crime, the hardest hitting Sean Hamilton on drums. Together they draw inspiration from classics like The Runaways, L7, and The Buzzcocks to create some modern noise that’s catchy enough to raise a fist and sing along. \r\n\r\nNoise Journal describes them as “a filthy rocket of pure jet-fuel up the nostril, with surf rock sensibilities, a grunge groove and hair metal swagger,” while Canadian Beats called their last album “reminiscent of Queens of the Stone Age meets The Animals – a certain coolness about it, making it impossible to forget.”\r\n\r\nTheir 2018 release Girls Girls Girls was produced by Danny Farrant of UK Punk Legends The Buzzcocks. The album reached #1 on Earshot!’s National Loud charts, and had singles hit #7 on CBC 3’s R3-30, and #1 on the Indigenous Music Countdown. It was even given attention from Rodney Bingenheimer’s Sirius XM show Rodney On The Rock.  \r\n\r\nGirls Girls Girls saw Miesha & The Spanks on the cover of Beatroute Magazine, accompanied by 30 dates across Canada, and festival appearances at Blizzard Music Fest (Rossland BC), Canadian Music Week (Toronto), Sled Island (Calgary), Rifflandia (Victoria BC), Halifax Pop Explosion (Halifax), Big Winter Classic (Calgary), The Great Escape (Brighton UK), FOCUS Wales (Wrexham UK), and Breakout West (Whitehorse YK).   \r\n\r\nAt the YYC Music Awards 2019, Girls Girls Girls brought home Rock Recording Of The Year and Single Of The Year (Summer Love), as well as securing Miesha as Female Artist Of The Year.

1454	Shayla Souliere’s latest single, ‘Know Better’, is as much an affirmation of her belief in the power of music as a mission statement; one that displays the Regina-based, pop artist’s desire to empower others through music, and her personal dedication to her craft, in equal measure.\r\n.\r\n“Music is my passion,” Souliere says. “It’s has always kept me going and I believe that it can help you rise above whatever life throws at you, and this song is a way of sharing that belief.”\r\n \r\nCo-written by Souliere, Brooke Williams and producer/mixer, AJ Afterparty, ‘Know Better’ will resonate with anyone who’s been made to feel that they’re not good enough by others, for any reason, at any time in their life. But for Souliere it’s personal; a reflection of the single-minded approach she’s taken to her career as a singer, songwriter and recording artist since day one.\r\n \r\nFor Souliere, in music and life, the only way to succeed is to refuse to take no for an answer and to move forward fearlessly and without hesitation, regardless of who tries to knock you down along the way. “As an artist you’re often told you should be more like somebody else, but everybody’s different – if they weren’t, the world would be very boring place.”\r\n \r\n“I do not ‘half ass’ anything in life,” continues Souliere, crediting the work ethic her family instilled in her early on. “When something gets hard you don’t quit. That really stuck with, and it’s something, I think, that’s helped me balance myself as an artist and stay true to who I am.”\r\n \r\nIn 2013, Souliere sold the car she bought herself during high school to bankroll her first recording sessions in Los Angeles. Since, she’s continued to travel regularly to write and record in LA, Toronto, and released multiple singles including ‘Days Like That’ (July 2019); ‘Let Me Go” (2018); ‘Over – Feat. Pimpton’ (2016) and ‘Screw U’ (2015). Note: re-ordered past singles starting with most current\r\n \r\nAdditionally, she’s personally brokered endorsement deals with brands including Bennett Dunlop Ford, Christian Paul Watches, Kranks Audio, Body Boss, and Love Your Melon, ultimately accumulating over 120,000 followers across her social media accounts.

1423	Raised on a small farm in southern Saskatchewan, Voss began his journey in music at the age of 8 when he picked up his Dad’s old flat top, and has been following in the footsteps of legendary troubadours like Steve Earle, Charlie Major, Tom Petty and Bruce Springsteen, ever since.\r\n \r\nFrom playing weekend gigs with his high school band, to gigging 6 nights a week in night clubs, to festivals and soft seaters, Voss has become known for his ability to fuse the ‘classic’ sounds of Country, into a piece of work that’s perfectly suited for our modern times.\r\n \r\nHe released his debut EP ‘Hillbilly Storybook’ in 2009 garnering a WMCA Producer of the Year nomination which put him on the map as an up and comer in Canada. In 2012, he followed it up with his sophomore album, ‘Show ‘em Who’s Voss’, landing him a SCMA Roots Album of the Year award and chart action for 5 singles on Canadian Country radio, including ‘It’s a Pride Thing’ which peaked #62 on Nielsen BDS Top 100 and ‘Playing For Keeps’ at #51. The album also received extensive international airplay, which led to Voss’ first overseas tour, playing shows in Germany, Ireland, France and the Netherlands, Colombia and Mexico in 2015.\r\n \r\nIn 2017 Voss was forced to take a hiatus from his career for one year to recover from major back surgery. Having been bedridden for a long period of time, with only social media, TV and the news as his connection to the outside world, Voss began to digest the current social trends involving nationalism, tribalism, polarization, division, and violence - all of which weighed heavy on his mind. He put pen to paper, and by 2018, he had written his 3rd album, ‘Come Along With Me’. \r\n \r\nWith a new album in hand, and a recent SCMA Roots Artist of the Year award to kick things off, Voss is back on the music scene and gearing up to take his career to the next level.\r\n \r\n‘Come Along With Me’ is scheduled for release this spring!

1778	Scarlett Butler is a new Canadian music duo comprised of Troy Kokol and Joni Delaurier. But ask anyone in the Canadian country music industry and they would be known better individually for crafting songs you have probably heard on the radio. \r\n\r\nAfter a decade of writing songs for country artists (250+ songs over the last decade) with and for artists like Shane Yellowbird, Brett Kissel, Tenille Townes, The Higgins, Mike Plume, and others, this talented duo stands on a solid foundation of well-crafted songs backed up by a soul-warming blend of familial harmonies. \r\n\r\nDelaurier and Kokol met at a songwriting event in Calgary, Alberta. “I heard him perform and I wondered who the hottie singing that song was,” laughs Delaurier. “Something about tall, dark, handsome, and talented sticks with you.” \r\n\r\nFor his part, Kokol says, “I heard her song and was like, that girl will write a hit song one day.” \r\n\r\nIt turned out to be true, sooner rather than later. Eventually, the two started dating and together took their first trip to Nashville. Soon after, they wrote Shane Yellowbird’s hit song “Pickup Truck”, which was listed as the #6 all-time song on Canadian country radio by Billboard and spent twelve weeks in the top 10 on BDS.  This earned the pair nominations for Canadian Country Music Song and Songwriters of the Year and opened many doors to collaborations with some of the best writers and artists on both sides of the border.

1614	Ryland Moranz was born a singer-songwriter. \r\n\r\nOriginally hailing from Fort Macleod, Alberta, Ryland currently resides within the quaint musical community and picturesque surroundings of Lethbridge.   His concise and lyrically driven songwriting is deep beyond his years with an emphasis on storytelling and an increasing awareness that life is always bigger than you think it is.  Sometimes politically satirical and often offset with fun loving humour, Ryland’s wit and social conscience shine through in the well crafted vernacular of a songwriter that has found what they believe in.  Accompanying himself with acoustic guitar, tenor guitar, Harmonica, and banjo, his multi instrumental approach provides the perfect foil to the words he puts to paper.\r\n\r\nA warm and engaging performer, Ryland has shared bills with great acts like Whitehorse, Pokey Lafarge, John Wort Hannam, C.R. Avery, Corb Lund, and Soda Pony as well as playing as a member of Leeroy Stagger and the Rebeltone Sound.  \r\n\r\nSome of Ryland's performance highlights include Calgary Folk Fest, Canmore Folk Fest, Americana Fest UK (London, EN), Celtic Connections Festival (Glasgow, Scotland), Rifflandia (Victoria BC) and Folk Alliance International (Kansas City, MO). \r\n\r\nAlthough music has always been the medium, what really runs through Ryland’s blood is words.  Crafting in the spirit of great departed songsmiths like Blaze Foley and Willie P. Bennett, Ryland has developed his particular style of performance and delivery around the chosen message.  An avid and self proclaimed history nerd, he draws stories from historic example and contemporary experience blending the common truths that bind it all together.  The result is an honest and empathetic look at the world through a lens of a would-be true believer in search of answers.  An introspective illusionist.  A dreaming explorer.  A believer in the knowledge that the words you speak should always mean something.

893	From festival stages to intimate house concerts, Piper and Carson remind us of why we go to see live music. Their songwriting is free and fiercely personal; as if it’s been running in the woods, washing in cold water, and howling with wolves. The couples undeniable chemistry and onstage presence draws the audience into the conversation. Piper’s immersive storytelling provides context and familiarity bringing their original music to life. After first meeting on Carson’s father’s organic vegetable farm, they’ve spent the last four years touring Canada coast-to-coast, showcasing at international Folk Conferences, touring overseas in the Netherlands and to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

1772	Katelin is a young Asian artist making waves in a predominant market for White and Black artists.\r\nDon’t let her age fool you, 16 years old Katelin Aragon has been performing in and around Alberta for 5 years. It all started at age 10 when she showed her parents her first original song in their living room one day. He father Phuong was so moved that he brought her to Cafe Koi the following week to sing the song in public. The reception was incredible and it turns out that Katelin was a natural with no stage freight.\r\nSince then, Katelin has performed at the prestigious Jack Singer Concert Hall, Bella Concert Hall, The Grey Eagle Event Center, The Edmonton Expo Center and many other events. In the mean time, Katelin continues to write music and hone her skills by busking on Stephen Avenue in the summer and the plus 15 in the winter to gage audience receptions of her music. Katelin’s music can be described as a mix of Noah Jones and Alicia Keys with a little bit of Daniel Caesar in between.

1721	3X EMA Award Winner Arlo Maverick is a Hip-Hop artist who aims to move his fans physically and emotionally. With his slogan of “Music that's well rounded like Beyonce's hips”, Arlo’s music is relatable and timely touching on everything from dating with trust issues, coping with suicide, to being undervalued at your 9 to 5.\r\n\r\nSonically, Arlo’s music tells a story much like his words. In listening to his music, you can hear how his wit and wordplay marry his musical scores that incorporate genres like Soul and EDM, but are distinctly hip-hop. When you consider that Arlo has received airplay in multiple countries (US, Japan), appeared in a variety of publications (Vice, Noisey), and charted on national campus radio charts (CMJ, Earshot) it’s clear his proficiency hasn’t gone unnoticed.\r\n\r\nStepping away from hip-hop’s tradition of just an MC and a DJ, Arlo incorporates this hip-hop staple with his live band, Rich Echo. Arlo’s live show, which he describes as a symbiotic exchange, has opened doors for him to headline festivals (North Country Fair, Sasquatch Gathering), open for hip-hop icons (Classified, Shad) and travel overseas (UK, South Korea).\r\n\r\nArlo is currently releasing singles to build interest for a full-length album.

1375	Born in the remote, river-laced hills of Northern Alberta, the Misery Mountain Boys is the black sheep brainchild of frontman Steven Gevenich, supplanted and enriched by bassist Lindsey Bueckert, clarinetist/saxophonist Sam Toms, & drummer Ethan Markwart. Each bring their impressive musicianship to the 7 year musical partnership, and this is readily apparent in the confidence of the four piece they embody. Playful bass lines, energetic, snare-heavy drums, meandering & melodic clarinet, and Gevenich’s own skillful jazz guitar and gentle, gravely voice form the musical landscape of the Misery Mountain Boys.\r\n\r\nMilk & Moonshine (2019)\r\n\r\nPaying homage to the Prohibition era practice of transporting liquor in milk bottles, their new release, “Milk & Moonshine”, is an embodiment of simplicity & rhythmic abandon. Moving organically from jazzy shuffles to saccharine love songs to upbeat jump blues, the collective delivers an offering both lighthearted and confident, breezy and grounded in their shared love of entertainment. The album listens as a piece that could very well be live - interspersed with candid count-ins and spontaneous instrumentals, but cleanly produced and thoughtful in its execution.\r\nA musical rarity in an industry busy with melancholy, the Misery Mountain Boys are a confident celebration of all that is exciting and moving about being alive. The project firmly asserts that playfulness & ease are sacred, and we all have the right to boogie.

1647	“Staying rooted within traditional forms and honoring those while also bringing in experimentation, Shumaila Hemani sings Sufi epics in South Asian Sufi tradition compellingly, says Rebecca Bruton from the New Works Calgary. Praised for enriching Edmonton by Edmonton Journal (2015), Hemani is locally celebrated for her “mesmerizing” and “emotionally nerve-striking” music that carries “vocal virtuosity,” expressing “radically different inner existential visions” (Calgary Herald, 2015). Shumaila Hemani, Ph.D. in Music from the University of Alberta and Former Music Faculty, Semester at Sea, Spring 2020 voyage, is an Alberta-based Sufi singer-songwriter, acousmatic composer, sing-style poet, spoken word artist, and traditional performer. Her composition: Perils of Heavy Rainfall, received a Second Prize at the Listening During COVID contest by the Canadian Association of Sonic Ecology (CASE). The pioneering Canadian soundscape composer Hildegard Westerkamp applauded her for beautifully taking the listeners to an immersive world of different music, chanting, and drones.\r\nHemani has performed at the FACTOR-funded International Women’s Day (2021) and Canadian Music Week (2021), Femme Wave Festival (2019) and the World Odyssey (2020) and presented virtual showcases for the Alberta Musical Theatre’s A World of Stories (2020), CJSW’s A Drop and the Turning (2021), and the Starlite Spotlight Sessions (2021), CJSR’s From Here We Go Sublime (2021). Her acousmatic compositions have been curated at the University of Alberta as sound installations and Society for Ethnomusicology’s R.L. Stevenson Prize (2016), Sounding Board (2020), and Annual Concert (2020). Once upon a time in Kobe, Japan, commissioned by The New Music Edmonton and published in their No Normal Podcast, Episode 5 (2021) reflects Hemani’s versatility as a music composer.\r\nHemani’s original: Anticipating was featured in the Cross-Canada tour for Suicide Prevention Awareness and Hope (2020) has been critically acclaimed for expressing “a visceral emotionality and a deep musicality expertly ushering listeners into a place of contemplation and consideration” (John Wright at Radio Airplay, 2020). Living with Purpose was #1 on Ethnocloud’s world music charts from January 2020 to Nov 2020, CBC Toyota National Searchlight (2021) and published in Alberta’s literary feminist magazine: New Forum (2021).\r\nHer traditional vocal performance crosses gender boundaries while singing Pakistani songs of Muslim heritage, which men typically perform. Her upcoming album is based around the concept of supplication and saint worship. These practices are braced by many religious cultures yet still resisted by mainstream orthodoxies who deem them as superstitious and illegitimate. Her musical poetry works to decolonize intercultural conversations by resisting cultural essentialism and binary mindset. Supported by the Cultural Diversity Award, Hemani will release her album trilogy: Awakening and Mannat, in 2021. Currently, Hemani is scheduled to perform for Femme Wave community transformation workshop (2022), Skirts A Fire (2022) and release her music albums.

Now, following the release of sophomore album Fear Has No Place Here, Stead is enjoying a career high, managing a top three finish in the Project Wild – Country Artist Development program, despite making roots music that is decidedly lacking in country twang.\r\n\r\nKen Stead already has a firm foothold in the Canadian roots community, having graced the grassy stages and sessions of Edmonton Folk Fest, Canmore Folk Fest, and North Country Fair, as well as rowdier standing room venues like the Calgary Stampede Coke Stage. Whether its Solo, duo or with his 5 piece festival band, Ken Stead makes every room feel like home. A generous demeanour, a delicate wit, and an empathetic understanding of audiences of all shapes, his performances are as true and honest as the songs themselves.\r\n\r\nKen Stead is known for silencing a room to a whisper, but with his new release, Civil War, he proves capable of starting an uproar. With more volume, comes more space to make heartfelt moments hit more closely, and big emotional moments rattle through your chest. Guitars, bass and drums punctuate charged lyricism and lived experience. It’s full and dynamic roots rock, with an emphasis on message, born from Stead’s keen musical interest in both folk and political hip hop.\r\n\r\nProduced by Winston Hauschild (Hannah Georgas, Hey Ocean), Civil War is an earnest portrait of the domestic, the conflicts present in the everyday, and how one’s struggle with themselves and their own faults bleed into their relationships with others, how that mirrors the larger political climate. Throughout the record, Stead grapples with his firm belief that peace begins with the individual. Tracks like “I’m Done Trying” are strong and self-critical, pining to understand the other with empathy and the earned conviction of its power-chords.\r\n\r\n Civil War is about bridging binaries and breaking barriers, both political and emotional, race and gender, husband and wife. Big and beautiful music that doesn’t need to polarize to speak strongly and directly.\r\n\r\n	["music"]	["americana","folk","rock","roots","singer-songwriter"]	25-40	\N	Ken Stead	780-292-4474	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1525120160/artist/518/cover_photo.jpg	2018-04-30 20:28:36.206+00	2019-12-05 10:09:35.653+00	January-October 2020	[{"name":"Big Vallery Jamboree Mainstage","date":"2018/08"},{"name":"Dauphin Country Fest","date":"2018/06"},{"name":"Beaumont Blues Fest Mainstage","date":"2019/06"}]	[]	[{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/kensteadmusic"},{"mediaType":"twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/kensteadmusic"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/kensteadmusic"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"http://www.kenstead.net"},{"mediaType":"youtubeChannel","url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU6eVXNb2MHE5IuHuNxTc-w/videos"},{"mediaType":"embeddedYoutube","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo15KThv0Pw"}]	Ken Stead has played everything from main stage BVJ to house concerts and can engage a crowd of any size with his voice, songs, and generous demeanor on stage.  	singer-songwriter	["alt-country","rock"]	originals	\N	fo15KThv0Pw	\N	\N	\N

1636	Dempsey’s music is influenced by his modern-day heroes such as Zanski, Dominic Fike and Jack Garratt as well as the legends he grew up with, namely Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson. Originally very interested in lush, dark and brooding productions and drawing inspiration from other works of art via painter Mark Rothko and writer Philip K. Dick, Dempsey has recently discovered a fascination with simplicity. His current direction is aimed towards eliciting emotion and creating vibe with sparser arrangements, letting the complexity lie in the writing and the harmony. \r\nWhile in school at University of Alberta finishing up a degree in Astrophysics, Dempsey began producing demos in his free time between classes. After graduating, he decided to forgo his Master’s Degree and began working on music full time. With his debut release “What About You” Dempsey garnered significant attention from curators and publications, landing on multiple Spotify editorial playlists including New Music Friday Canada and receiving glowing reviews from bloggers and journalists alike:\r\n“With a sense of melody above all, a production of beauty and a talent that transpires and leaves no chance for doubt, Dempsey Bolton plunges us into a musical break that will have an effect on you” - IGGY Magazine  \r\nDempsey is currently working on his sophomore album set to release in July 2023, a self-produced project that starkly contrasts the lyrics and music; the album deals with the dangers of staying silent while in crisis and letting one’s mental health go unchecked while delivering upbeat, nostalgic, summery vibes in its production. \r\n	["music"]	[]	18-35, any gender, fans of Pop, RnB and Indie.	\N	Dempsey Bolton	7809025389	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1658778206/artist/1636/cover_photo.jpg	2020-06-17 16:28:03.442+00	2022-07-25 19:59:48.393+00	\N	[{"name":"K Days South Stage","date":"2018/07"},{"name":"University of Alberta Main Stage, Week of Welcome","date":"2019/09"},{"name":"The Rec Room, Double Headline","date":"2020/01"}]	[{"index":0,"publicId":"artist/1636/hi-res/0.jpg","version":1649275504},{"index":2,"publicId":"artist/1636/hi-res/2.jpg","version":1649275567}]	[{"mediaType":"embeddedYoutube","url":"https://youtu.be/VMUKDNsMHg8"},{"mediaType":"youtubeChannel","url":"https://www.youtube.com/c/dempseybolton"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/dempsey_bolton"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"https://www.dempseybolton.com"},{"mediaType":"spotify","url":"https://open.spotify.com/track/4zpOChyng24EtoTgt7dOsZ?si=WuCN5YGrSn25vm4hfOrAOQ&utm_source=copy-link"},{"mediaType":"appleMusic","url":"https://music.apple.com/ca/artist/dempsey-bolton/1471269313"},{"mediaType":"tiktok","url":"https://www.tiktok.com/@dempseybolton"}]	Indie Pop/RnB artist-producer Dempsey Bolton is currently working on his sophomore album set to release in July 2023.	pop	["rb","soul"]	originals	\N	VMUKDNsMHg8	\N		["white"]

The project started as Sare’s solo DIY recording project that came alive in between procrastinated engineering school assignments and a burning desire to make sense of the discomfort of growing up as someone who never really could fit in.\r\n\r\nAs Stem Champ, Sare self-released a series of digital projects on bandcamp, the latest being Kill the Imposter – an EP about embracing the turbulence of a summer together after a long winter apart. It’s the tale of a summertime spent trying to piece together broken friendships, reconnecting with old friends, and learning to trust oneself. \r\n\r\nKill The Imposter marks a sonic shift in Sare’s production, bringing in layered guitars, keyboards, and drum tracks – a notable departure from the acoustic recordings of earlier releases. This sonic shift would lead Sare to bring together new and old friends to play these songs live in full stereo rock.\r\n\r\nThese days Stem Champ (live) is Sare, Zane (of Free Golf Clubs), Kaitlyn, Daniela, and C.

2030	The Artist In Question\r\n\r\nAshton Souliere Raving Lunatic,\r\n\r\nOne that escapes many boxes of normality, he ad-libs a lot of his lyrics, plays a lot of indie covers and can’t stop playing the strokes.\r\n\r\nHe loves to sing everywhere he can and sometimes acts like a fool by grooving in the public streets. Any feeling of good he can hold on to he tries boosting to the skies; letting the world know he’s looking and feeling good. \r\n\r\nMost of all he just wants to rise to the task and show people the hard work he’s put into himself as an artist. Hoping it’s good enough to be liked :). \r\n\r\nHopefully he’s an intriguing enough idea to land some time somewhere.

158	T. Buckley stands quietly among a disappearing ilk of true craftsmen. Shadowed by his Western roots, his soul and voice are unmistakably genuine, and the result is a class of songsmith long revered and scarcely achieved.\r\n\r\nAn award-winning songwriter, T. Buckley looks through the lens of life with his sixth album, Frame By Frame, released November 5, 2021 via Fallen Tree Records. Buckley delivers another trademark smooth and soulful vocal performance that makes him one of western Canada's most talked-about artists. The recording sessions were fused in the winter of 2020 at the National Music Centre in Calgary, Alberta, with notable producer Jeff Kynoch and a core group of players: Jesse Dollimont on mandolin, guitar and harmony vocals; Mitch Jay on stringed things; Steve Fletcher on keys and organs; Dan Stadnicki on drums; and Keith Rempel on bass. Kynoch's open-minded sonic approach makes for an excellent pairing with Buckley's spirit of creatively pushing the envelope.\r\n\r\n"A singer-songwriter who more than merits the title." - Americana UK\r\n\r\n"Songs this easy to understand and enjoy are crafted and polished, every thought precise and each line a little gem" - Bob Mersereau/CBC correspondent \r\n	["music"]	["roots"]	Typically Age 35 - 65	\N	Tim Buckley 	4033905096	bookings@tbuckley.ca	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1638897523/artist/158/cover_photo.jpg	2017-06-19 18:45:58.938+00	2021-12-07 17:23:37.947+00	\N	[{"name":"International Folk Alliance Conference,  Official Showcase Artist, Kansas City MO","date":"2022/02"},{"name":"Americana Fest Official Showcase Artist, Nashville Tennessee","date":"2019/09"},{"name":"Calgary Folk Festival, Calgary AB","date":"2019/07"}]	[{"index":0,"publicId":"artist/158/hi-res/0.jpg","version":1638897779},{"index":1,"publicId":"artist/158/hi-res/1.jpg","version":1638897816}]	[{"mediaType":"embeddedYoutube","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGs7hWS-9qY"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"http://www.tbuckley.ca"},{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/tbuckleymusic"},{"mediaType":"twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/TBuckleymusic"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/tbuckleymusic/"},{"mediaType":"youtubeChannel","url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkYbVtRvjXPZ9ulk7c3li6Q"},{"mediaType":"spotify","url":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/3uMfRdAAdTRyi0Kg2qCxmo"},{"mediaType":"appleMusic","url":"https://music.apple.com/ca/album/miles-we-put-behind/1437005072?app=music"}]	T.

665	Since their formation in 2012, The Ashley Hundred has been constantly writing, stripping apart, and rewriting the songs of each of the band members. Continually growing as a band and as individual musicians. The bands first 2013 release, Postcards From The Moon, marked their firm arrival into the Calgary music scene, and brought them across the country on campus radio charts and on the stages from BC to Quebec. Soon after the release of their debut EP, Calgary veterans 36? approached the band to collaborate on a Split LP, which lead The Ashley Hundred to their first vinyl release, and first professionally produced music video made with funding from the Telus Storyhive grant. Their most recent Self-Titled release of September 2017, made with Juno award winning producer Josh Gwilliam and gold record holding engineer Spencer Cheyne was their most ambitious yet covering a vast sonic territory from bouncy psych-pop, to introspective ballad.

1461	Featuring a fanciful vocal give-and-take between singers Cody Pemberton and Selena Nemeth.  Their signature sound is cultivated from experienced and tasteful beats, high energy and explorative bass lines and a self taught classical influenced style of acoustic guitar. This lays the ground work for Pembertons' coarse howls, which conjure the likenesses of Tom Waits-meets-Daniel Johnston. While Nemeth soothes the sonic spectrum with her melodic soprano and haunting harmonies. Incorporating the sounds of bands like July Talk, Tom Waits, Cage the Elephant and Len, WOLFA presents songs from the soul, represented without compromise.

1444	The Cadillac Junkies are a very energetic band who dabble in the mixture of a modern and vintage sound. If Chris Stapleton and Elle King were to have any offspring, it would probably sound like The Cadillac Junkies. They have a swampy roots vibe alongside a pop, rock blues edge. Their sound and energy is defined in their shows where they leave it all out on the table.In the summer they won the Alberta Rockstar Talent Search Contest where they were able to record two new singles with DanLyn Studios and Miles Wilkinson. After that, they were inspired to start creating something entirely different! You can expect a new brand, new sound and a much more evolved version of the Cadillac Junkies you once knew. Look for their newest single "Cocaine"being released February 29, 2020.\r\n\r\nYou might have heard them this summer at The Coke Stage during Calgary Stampede, Edmonton Rockfest, First Responders Rodeo Edmonton, Hallywood Jamboree and The Fringe. They were also asked to be a feature band representing the Calgary Stampede on CBC television with their song “Country Love!” Remember when The Cadillac Junkies toured Sweden two years ago and played The Live At Heart Musicfest? Well it’s coming to Canada and they’ve been invited! St. John’s Newfoundland better get ready for a Cadillac Junkie invasion!

1621	Dredged from the depths of Edmonton’s only haunted swamp, and raised on yarns of misfits and outcasts, Waldo Poblano weaves lyrical character studies that explore addiction, loss, and the conflict between idealized and demonized personalities. Drawing inspiration from Baroque Folk, Gregorian Blues, and Classical Greco-Roman Bossa Nova, Waldo Poblano blends these influences with a vintage Rock and Roll sensibility to bring a new perspective and incisive wit to tales of hot-ties gone wrong. As one fan described, Waldo plays “fresh, funky and infinitely spreadable tunes - the blue cheese of music.”\r\n\r\nAfter releasing his debut solo  EP Preserved In Wax in 2018 Waldo was joined by drummer, Ryan Donaldson, and bassist, Gordon Tober, and as a band they started to reimagine Waldo Poblano’s sound to be more energetic and raw. With driving drums and rhythmic bass backing up syncopated guitar, Waldo Poblano delivers a visceral and dynamic live show while maintaining the roots that initially inspired Waldo’s writing. \r\n\r\nWaldo Poblano recorded a new 5-song EP, Mothballs & Manifestos, which was released on May 29th, 2020.

1483	Siydock is a singer-songwriter launching his career out of Toronto, Ontario. His percussive style of guitar melds rock and jazz influences with an upbringing rooted in folk and blues. “Captivating character,” says Rootstime, in recognition of his attention to detail and reclusive nature. Pair this with genuine lyricism and unique melodic lines, and you have a performer you won’t want to miss.

1561	Superstitious people pay attention to signs. Maybe it’s easier to leave one’s fate up to an omnipresent being, even if it’s a little risky. But sometimes, there are signs so pure, so true, that one cannot help but heed their call. It’s too coincidental not to. So, on a walk one day, in a familiar place, in a familiar way, a sign found its way to Marlaena Moore.\r\n\r\nMoore walked past a familiar church that she lives nearby in Edmonton, AB. It was one she saw often, seeing it but not really looking at it, until, one day, when a billboard for the church had the phrase “Pay Attention! Be Amazed!” Here, Moore had her very literal sign. “To me, this phrase just means looking out for different perspectives and trying to see what's right in front of you, just slightly differently, and then seeing if your perspective changes,” Moore says. \r\n\r\nOn her third record, Pay Attention! Be Amazed!, to be released this spring, the 26 year-old musician does indeed shift her perspective in different ways. With the help of Chris Dadge and Chad VanGaalen on production and a crew of musical artists Moore calls “unbelievable human beings with ungodly talent,” Moore’s newest full-length record fills out and strengthens the sound she has been building for years, while simultaneously gesturing at where her work can grow. \r\n\r\nPay Attention! Be Amazed! has familiar themes that appear in Moore’s earlier work. Moore says her first two records displayed a specific sense of yearning. “Everything I was writing was really about the yearning and desire for finding love,” she says. ”I feel like the thing that weaves everything together on this latest record is what happens when you are there. You have found this relationship and it's like it's the reality of the fantasy of the relationship that you've always wanted.” But, in the end, it’s a relationship doomed.\r\n\r\n“All Alone (Full of Love)” sounds like a swinging, morose track fit for the jukebox on a lonely, dreary evening. It has the contours of a pop song. “Xmas Oranges,” a devastating but sparkling jewel on this record, traces the motions of being a relationship souring, as Moore sings revelations so plainly over a steady, anxious and tight guitar strum. On “Imposter,” Moore solemnly proclaims she’s a stranger to her heart. \r\n\r\nWorking on what would become Pay Attention! Be Amazed! Moore found how much more she needed a collaborative environment to work in. The songs took the shape they did, sounding so rich and morose and triumphant all at once precisely because of the crew assembled to amplify them to their fullest.

Despite a late musical start, learning to play strong rhythm guitar and a couple of bluegrass licks provided the platform for a very organic and classic country sound. The band has played summer music festival's, community fair's, theaters and barn lofts - sharing the stage with many talented players.\r\n\r\nBy soulful, baritone delivery, His witty Cowboy songs, hurting ballads and confessions of the wandering soul are sure to connect with people.

1597	I am Gisela Romero, I am a versatile Latin singer with a strong love for traditional Mexican Music and a Jazz enthusiast. I was born in Leon México in 1981, and I have lived in Canada since 2008. I was educated in Singing, Harmony, and musical theory at Cultural Center Mexico contemporáneo in Aguascalientes México, and in Graphic Design at La Salle University in Leon México.\r\nI started singing at the age of 9, but my professional development as a singer began in my teenage years. More than 20 wonderful years have passed, full of music and amazing experiences that have fulfilled my life. I have had the opportunity to work in several projects in Canada and Mexico as a lead singer with many bands in both countries, some musicals and also as backup singer with important Latin figures like José Alberto “El Canario”, Maelo Ruiz, David Pabon, and Jerry Rivera. I have participated in various editions of festivals, mostly in the Canadian west coast, such as Expolatino, Mexifest, Lilac Festival, Taste of Calgary, Fiestaval, Saskatoon Salsa Congress, and Regina Latin Fest, to mention some.\r\nFrom 2012 to 2018 I was a co-owner of Joker Entertainment, a company specialized in concert logistics and production. During that time, we produced a total of 26 shows with some of the most important Latin Grammy award winning artist from all over Latin America, the Caribbean, and Spain, all in Calgary.\r\nIn 2015 I won first place in the Spanish category of the Contest Multicultural Idol produced by RED FM in Calgary. In 2019 I was awarded as Best Solo Singer by Fiestaval latin fest and the Calgary Multicultural Art Society. I released my fist album “Mil veces más” In July of 2019; which was nominated for the YYC music awards 2020 in the category of World Recording of the Year.\r\nI’m an artist made in Mexico and grown in Canada. My voice is my experience, my work, my talent. I am my voice, my roots and my art and I’m enormously proud to be Mexican and Canadian, well...Mexicanadian!

547	Educated at the Jazz program at Capilano University in Vancouver. Originally from Sweden where formal music education was also attended. Plays a wide range of improvisational music, with both feet planted in the bebop and hardbop Era.  As a solo act I play mainly jazz standards arranged for solo guitar. In duos with bass players, the music is often rooted in the jazz standard repertoire but gravitates also towards more jammy and free improvisations. In trios and quartets, I play the standard repertoire with some, and groove based, improvised music with others. When hired as a sideman for Alex Ginella in the Alex Ginella Band, the music is mainly rock with one foot in folk and bluegrass music. I have also played in several reggae and hiphop bands.	["music"]	["jazz"]	Jazz shows at jazz venues are usually attended by an older crowd, mixed with young people who are themselves playing jazz.

2299	Formed in 2019 by soprano Kathleen Morrison and mezzo soprano Barbara King, Divas Opera strives to make what has sometimes been called an 'elite art form' more welcoming and relatable. The Divas are as comfortable in front of a full orchestra as they are with backing tracks on a balcony, and are known for their dazzling (and numerous) gown changes. Engaging and approachable, the Divas perform everything from classical opera, musical theatre, pop, jazz, and even some country pieces! \r\nAudiences are drawn in by the technical ability, but they stay and return to future performances feeling welcomed and at home. Singing and performing is their passion.\r\n\r\nDivas Opera has performed recently at numerous events, including the 'Summer on 17th', 'National Music Centre presents: King Eddy Classical - Divas Opera', 'Bella Italia at the Polaris Centre for the Performing Arts', and 'The Calgary Italian Cultural Centre's 70th Anniversary', and numerous Christmas performances in the Brookfield properties (2019). In August of 2022, they were featured as one of CTV's Inspired Albertans. Charity work is also important to the Divas, and they have lent their voices to CTV's Toy Mountain Campaign (2019 & 2021), Mysterious Barricades: A Concert for Suicide Awareness, The Calgary Emergency Women's Shelter, and numerous others. \r\n\r\nDivas Opera is available to perform with backing tracks to a full orchestra.

1304	Tenise Marie is a 24 year-old singer/songwriter whose ambition is to travel the world and return home to sing about it. She grew up singing Bob Dylan around campfires in Argenta, BC at the north end of beautiful Kootenay Lake. In 2015, Tenise graduated from the Selkirk College Music Program with a diploma in Vocal Performance. Since then, she has been the fortunate recipient of four grants from the Columbia Basin Trust and the Columbia Kootenay Cultural Alliance. This greatly appreciated funding resulted in two recordings of original music: Oxygen (2016) and The Sailor & The Gypsy (2018), and two corresponding tours of BC and Alberta in 2017 and 2018. Tenise’s music is deeply rooted in acoustic guitar and honest lyrics, continually growing as her voice matures.

1532	Kurt Loewen is a songwriter, producer and multi instrumentalist who has spent much of his career in music writing, performing and traveling with The Tequila Mockingbird Orchestra. Loewen's forthcoming record, Becker Lake, stays true to form lyrically and sonically to his 2019 Heavy & Low, but will be 100% self produced from his home studio.  The inability to perform publicly during this unprecedented time has given him the opportunity and time to take a deep dive into the songwriting and recording processes.  As a result 8 songs have emerged as a body of work representative of the time spent largely in solitude.  The themes, however, convey that of hope, openheartedness, kindness, and optimism which, thematically and unto itself, is a departure from last year's Heavy & Low.

Over that time, Nolan played over 175 shows across North America and six European countries, most while traveling in his faithful 2003 Dodge Caravan. Along the way he also recorded the EP Rootsy House Sessions in Sweden, and signed deals with Mongrel Music Agency (Chuck Prophet, Lake Street Dive), as well as European label Rootsy Records (John Prine, Patti Griffin, Anderson East). His work also earned the Cobalt Prize for songwriting at the 2018 Maple Blues Awards, as well as Blues Artist Of The Year at the Edmonton Music Awards. Furthermore, Nolan was nominated for Roots Solo Artist Of The Year at Breakout West 2019, capping off a truly momentous comeback, which is still in its early stages.\r\n\r\nDrifters begins the next leg of that journey, made at Riverdale Recorders in Edmonton with engineer Scott Franchuk, Nolan just released this beautiful 10 song acoustic record.

1485	The musical kaleidoscope of opera singer to jazz singer, a year singing in an African American gospel choir and 5 years performing in Europe makes Monika Walls' music singular. When 3 new songs, all in one night, called her to write her own songs these musical worlds cross pollinated into the creation of a new sound. Two studio albums ‘Parallel Mondo’ a jazz inspired album of original's (2013- producer Mike Falk) and ‘Earth’- prairie folk/pop and gospel/blues originals (Nov. 2018- Juno award winning producer Murray Pulver) reflect the craftsmanship and heart of its maker.

1533	The long dark winters, frantic harvests and endless gravel roads of northern Alberta have played a huge role in shaping the genuinely honest, shady and desperate characters that find their way into Jake Ian’s wonderfully authentic songs.  Ian’s deep respect for the working man and obvious soft spot for the underdog makes its way into countless themes of real life, real love, heartbreak and persistence.\r\n\r\nWhether performing alone or with his backing band, its Jake Ian’s intelligent and lyrically focused songwriting that always takes center stage, winning him any number of admirers in Western Canada’s folk and country scene. He has toured and performed in bars, coffee shops, theatres, folk clubs and festivals across Canada and has shared the stage with performers such as Hawksley Workman, Kelly Joe Phelps, Devil Makes Three and Tim Hus.\r\n\r\nIan released his most recent album, “The Trestle” on CD, cassette and digital platforms in early 2017.  Listeners have been comparing the album to Bruce Springsteen’s Nebraska…a sparse and haunting collection of songs recorded in Ian’s home.  “The Trestle” received consistent airplay on college radio across Canada and peaked at #2 on the Earshot National Folk/Roots/ Blues chart.     \r\n\r\nIan released his newest album “Half A Day Away” on May 28, 2020.

This kind of chemistry from a band is a real, rare treat.” - Bill Kolter, Peachfest Entertainment Coordinator.\r\n\r\nThe original band members met in music school, where most of them studied Jazz.

1701	*Jesse Roads tours and performs regularly both solo with his acoustic handcrafted Gilmore guitar and or with a full band.\r\n\r\nJesse was born in the city of Lethbridge and raised to his teen years in the southern Alberta farming communities of Raymond and Fin Castle, AB. Jesse's early inspirations include the hypnotic sounds of big-name artists such as Jimi Hendrix, The Black Crowes, Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, City and Colour, Jack Johnson, Guns 'N' Roses, and Pink Floyd.\r\n\r\nJesse is a Blues/Rock/folk/Indie performer who has done his fair share of "paying his dues" opening and touring with such acts as: The Lazys, One Bad Son, Doc Walker, The Odds, The Northern Pikes, The Grapes Of Wrath, Monster Truck, The Age Of Electric, The Wild, Holly McNarland, Econoline Crush, Coal Creek Boys, Wild T & The Spirit, Cara Luft, Carson Cole, Clayton Bellamy (of The Road Hammers), Tupelo Honey, Retrograde, The Smalls, and Mcquaig to name just a few.\r\n\r\nIn 2015 Jesse was awarded the title "Master of Blues Folk Rock" for the 6th Annual Black American Music Awards.\r\n\r\nJesse is known for his funky heavy jam style guitar. Big riffs, an impressive vocal sound all his own and the ability to captivate the crowd with ease. His fans have coined the term "no string solo" as he can be consistently found ripping strings off the guitar like they aren't supposed to be there in the first place.

1511	The year is 2015. Maurice van Hoek (January 25, 1992) is a talented student at the conservatory, but with a faltering musical compass. In a search for direction, he flees his education and his hometown of Rotterdam to travel through America for three months. During his wanderings he lets go of everything. He explores the area where the seventies country folk of icons such as The Eagles and James Taylor originated and is more attracted to the genre than ever. The expressiveness of the music emanates from Van Hoek. “You have to be able to say three chords and speak the truth. Everything the song serves. ”\r\n\r\nVan Hoek is relieved to return to the Netherlands, with a vision and to do what he prefers to do: write songs. Personal songs about his experiences far away overseas, and his emotions close by. He has found his niche, picks up his studies again, works on his compositions at the same time, forms a band around him and completes his first album with "Live Forevermore", which will be released in May 2016. That same year, Van Hoek graduated cum laude and the album can also count on excellent figures from the national music journal.\r\n\r\nVan Hoek then also wants to show and hear more live. He tackles all performance areas and in a short time grows with his band into a close-knit unit. He writes many new songs and visits the studio again to capture the fresh work with his band. That results in a second album "Traveling Man" in September 2018. Mindful of the title, Van Hoek once again tells about everything that comes his way, but the quality of the release also illustrates a crystal clear course: a straight line towards the top. With merely rave reviews, a release tour, a series of in stores and media appearances at, among others, Muziekcafé (NPO Radio 2) and VI (Veronica's football program, at the invitation of Danny Vera), the traveling man is fully on the road to achieve his goal .\r\n\r\n\r\n“One of the best Dutch country rock albums of 2018” - Heaven Magazine\r\n\r\n“Traveling Man deserves to be heard far and wide” Altcountry.nl	["music"]	[]	\N	\N	Atazia 	+31683318547	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1583684066/artist/1511/cover_photo.jpg	2020-03-08 15:52:28.267+00	2020-03-08 16:32:49.35+00	\N	\N	[{"index":0,"publicId":"artist/1511/hi-res/0.jpg","version":1583684810},{"index":1,"publicId":"artist/1511/hi-res/1.jpg","version":1583684824},{"index":2,"publicId":"artist/1511/hi-res/2.jpg","version":1583684833}]	[{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/maurice.vanhoek/"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/mauricevanhoek/"},{"mediaType":"youtubeChannel","url":"https://www.youtube.com/user/HoekMauricevan"},{"mediaType":"embeddedYoutube","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUCVSQt3P-g"}]	Country Americana Musician from The Netherlands 	singer-songwriter	["americana","country"]	originals	\N	gUCVSQt3P-g	\N	\N	\N

The venerable musician creates feel-good music with dark undertones, telling conceptual stories and wearing heart on sleeve through every show. Dave has journeyed from skins to strings, putting the sticks down after seven years as a professional drummer to build rhythm-centric music with imaginative strumming techniques and velvety vocals. Dave's voice works through his rhythmic melodies like water, swimming from piercing falsettos to powerful tones. If Tool were folk artists or Paul Simon was a drummer, you might find Dave's sound.

1727	As a pre-teen street corner busker, some of Jarvis’s earliest performances took place outside. He returned to an open-air environment for his new album Sundry Rock Song Stock’s creation, setting up a makeshift studio to lay down its foundation of guitar, Nord synth, and Rhodes electric piano. Recording on a reel-to-reel tape machine, he experimented with various off-kilter techniques including a softly tapped steel drum drenched in effects, or melodies played on a wine glass meant to mimic a flute. \r\n \r\n“I want my recordings to be naturalist, so from that sense I am ideally making them outside,” says Jarvis. “More than a musician or a singer, I’m a producer, and any studio I’m in will become my bedroom. Creation is my life and I don’t compartmentalize it at all.”\r\n	["music"]	[]	13-45 age range	\N	Colleen Krueger 	4038509636	\N	f	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1598539615/artist/1727/cover_photo.jpg	2020-08-27 14:43:36.016+00	2020-09-21 19:27:13.306+00	\N	[]	[]	[{"mediaType":"embeddedYoutube","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsEf74t1dyc"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/yvesjarvis"},{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/yvesjarvis"},{"mediaType":"twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/yvesjarvis"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"http://www.yvesjarvis.com"},{"mediaType":"spotify","url":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/19h4y2F9duQ776bv1YhQYt?si=YKIs_M_tQLutEaJD6hvUBg"},{"mediaType":"appleMusic","url":"https://music.apple.com/ca/artist/yves-jarvis/1180809151"},{"mediaType":"soundCloud","url":"https://soundcloud.com/flemisheye/sets/sundry-rock-song-stock"},{"mediaType":"bandcampArtist","url":"https://yvesjarvis.bandcamp.com/"},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://yvesjarvis.bandcamp.com/track/for-props","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"2033661011"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://yvesjarvis.bandcamp.com/track/semula","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"211487613"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://yvesjarvis.bandcamp.com/album/sundry-rock-song-stock","metadata":{"type":"album","id":"3047128927"}}]	“Audet’s work is haunting yet inviting, blending careful folk-noir with tender R&B flourishes, pillowy vocal beds, and a punkish ambivalence”  - XLR8R	alternative	["folk","rb"]	originals	\N	VsEf74t1dyc	\N	\N	\N

Groove-mining breakdowns become the stuff of legend as the four pieces’ floor-thudding tail kick and hellfire halo holler originates a whole that is far more potent than the sum of its individual elements. Meet your new astromancers, the phase-shifting and hard-rocking force that channels the empyreal sounds of heaven on Earth.  \r\n	["music"]	[]	For fans of heavy psychedelic rock	\N	Devin "Darty" Purdy	4036085794	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1533843138/artist/646/cover_photo.jpg	2018-08-09 19:28:15.556+00	2020-06-13 23:15:09.781+00	\N	[{"name":"Sled Island","date":"2018/06"},{"name":"UP&DT Festival","date":"2018/10"},{"name":"Brant Bjork","date":"2018/10"}]	[{"index":0,"publicId":"artist/646/hi-res/0.jpg","version":1533843572}]	[{"mediaType":"embeddedYoutube","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Ck4IyCJI4"},{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/gonecosmic"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/gonecosmic"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"https://gonecosmic.bandcamp.com/"},{"mediaType":"youtubeChannel","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Ck4IyCJI4"},{"mediaType":"twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/gonecosmicband"},{"mediaType":"spotify","url":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/0dXvqs9IfPVGj3YXcShKdf"},{"mediaType":"soundCloud","url":"https://soundcloud.com/user-114933626"},{"mediaType":"bandcampArtist","url":"https://gonecosmic.bandcamp.com/"},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://gonecosmic.bandcamp.com/track/deadlock","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"1353881349"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://gonecosmic.bandcamp.com/track/faded-release","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"268511289"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://gonecosmic.bandcamp.com/track/my-design","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"952788601"}}]	Celestial blues to quench your hedonist heart's desires.

1445	The Corazones are a versatile roots-rock band based in Calgary, Alberta. These guys pour their heart into every performance. The Corazones' songs draw inspiration from those mornings when you want to kiss the beautiful person you woke up next to, but have yet to gargle with mouthwash. They write songs about small towns, love, loneliness, and coffee. Actually, a lot of songs about coffee. They spent serious amounts of time learning to recreate the squeeks and hums from those 70’s albums you love so that they can make songs that make you want to dance while somehow also leaving you with the desire to slam your bedroom door, put on your headphones, and wait for your parents to figure out where they went wrong. The Corazones love 60's funk, 70's folk, Canadiana and all the noise in between. While their shows are powerfully fun and light-hearted, their lyrics poetically examine the beautiful intricacies of life, love, family, and song. They want to invite you to come see them play live. You’ll probably want to dance. If they’re playing outside your kids will dance and you’ll realize it’s way more fun if you join them. They’ll play a bunch of songs that you know you like, some songs you kinda remember liking the one time you heard them, and lots of songs that you may never have heard before, but that you’d like to have around so you can hear them again. Make sure you talk to them after the show... they love that! They’re good at making people wish they’d invited that other friend who would have really liked the show. Lucky for them, you’ll have lots of chances to do just that.

920	One of Calgary’s most exciting young artists, Jahimba Hutson single-handedly puts to rest the tired and entirely ridiculous notion that the city has no hip-hop scene, or no good hip-hop scene"  Mike Bell –Calgary Herald \r\nJahimba Hutson a.k.a. A.Y.E. was born into a musical family, getting an early start on stage performing with his father’s rasta reggae band Strugglah as keyboardist & emcee, while in junior high. The band shared the stage with such luminaries as the Wailers, Burning Spear and Jimmy Cliff. A young A.Y.E. watched carefully, listening and learning first-hand from Strugglah. \r\nA.Y.E. was born in Calgary, and raised in Vancouver, Montreal and Calgary exposing him to eclectic musical influences including Bob Marley, Nas, Red Hot Chilli Peppers, Supercat, Common, Jay-Z, Tribe Called Quest, Kardinal Official, Steel Pulse, Lincoln Park, Agustus Pablo, Sly & Robbie, and Jacob Miller, to mention but a few. \r\nAt 16, A.Y.E. co-founded Hutson Fam Music Group with his brother and sister, and eventually set out on his own to pursue his own craft and set himself apart in the hip-hop/urban scene locally. Upon releasing his first EP “Goodbye” in 2012 he was quickly identified by national publications and bloggers as one of Western Canada’s young emerging talents.  In 2014, he released his first self-produced full length “90 Now” which was a nod to the hip-hop that first influenced him. The album announced him as a major talent on the Canadian scene, and introduced him at an international level, selling copies from South Korea to L.A. A label in France also released the album in a limited edition run on vinyl.\r\n A.Y.E. was Allan Slaight Juno Master Class 2017-2018 top 10 finalist, nominated for Rap Recording of the Year at the 2019 YYCMAs (Calgary Music Awards) and Musical Group of the Year at the 2016 Obsidian Awards with The Extraordinary Gentlemen. His forth coming album Soul Food the Audiobiography Of.. was released the summer of 2019 and charted #1 on the National Hip Hop Charts via Ear-shot Campus Radio.\r\nListed by CBC Music as an "emerging act to watch" (2017). \r\n\r\nTHE EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN\r\nA diverse array of sounds from funk, rnb, blues, reggae, layered atop a raw, soulful hip-hop foundation. A.Y.E. and his band, The Extraordinary Gentlemen are proof that it's okay to stand outside the box. A.Y.E. truly possess an undeniable warm energy with his smooth delivery and captivating stage presence. The addition of the band's unique musical taste they create the perfect harmony of what they title "soul food".\r\nSince the group first got together in 2012, they've performed at several music festivals and venues such as Canadian Music Week, One Love Music Festival, Sled Island, The Works Music Festival, Fozzy Fest, and recently embarked on a western Canada tour in the fall of 2019.

There are plenty of twists, turns & genre bending moments... Suffice it to say Yeah, Yeah, No is fit to be played on the radio and very loudly” (Edmonton Muse).\r\n	["music"]	[]	University students, adults 18 - 44	\N	Brandon Baker	587-914-7116	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1591734756/artist/1537/cover_photo.jpg	2020-06-09 20:30:34.411+00	2020-06-09 20:35:59.755+00	\N	[{"name":"Canada's Music Incubator Showcase at the King Eddy, Calgary AB","date":"2019/12"},{"name":"Beaumont Blues and Roots Festival with Funkafeelya, Beaumont AB","date":"2019/06"},{"name":"BreakOut West with King of Foxes, Whitehorse, Yukon","date":"2019/10"}]	[{"index":0,"publicId":"artist/1537/hi-res/0.png","version":1591734810}]	[{"mediaType":"embeddedYoutube","url":"https://youtu.be/cnHt5057Ifs"},{"mediaType":"youtubeChannel","url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8OsJceoyudvcvlbsrbnM1w"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/electricreligious/"},{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/electricreligious/"},{"mediaType":"twitter","url":"https://www.twitter.com/ER_YEG"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"http://electricreligious.com"},{"mediaType":"spotify","url":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/1uWq30P8hc9Xf5yhS1m6yJ?si=7OH47UQPT26eXP0blXuZOQ"},{"mediaType":"bandcampArtist","url":"https://electricreligious.bandcamp.com/"},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"http://electricreligious.bandcamp.com/track/revolution-2","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"1657668944"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://electricreligious.bandcamp.com/track/lost-found-2","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"1815022581"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://electricreligious.bandcamp.com/track/marionette-2","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"3859782741"}}]	Electric Religious is the project of Métis singer, songwriter, and guitarist, Brandon Baker, whose guitar-driven music has been described as bursting with inspiration, insight, and hope.	rock	["alternative"]	originals	\N	cnHt5057Ifs	\N	\N	\N
1592	Armed with a soulful, velvety voice, Edmonton-based singer/songwriter Kaeley Jade effortlessly blends lush poetry and hooky melodic lines to craft music that is both playful and poignant. Reminiscent of artists like Maggie Rogers, Vance Joy and Taylor Swift, the Métis artist explores the beauty and complexity of human relationships in her vibrant and polished indie pop. \r\n\r\nSince dropping her debut EP Years Ago in 2020, Jade has been making waves in the Canadian music scene. After a strong community response, “Years Ago” was added to the regular rotation on 102.3 NOW! Radio (Jim Pattison Broadcast Group). Her music has been added to major editorial playlists across DSPs—such as New Music Friday and Fresh Finds on Spotify, and Indigenous Now on Apple Music—and featured in numerous publications including Tinnitist (500k+ Twitter followers), SAY Magazine and The GATE.\r\n\r\nKaeley Jade’s music has been played on radio stations across North America; her single “Highway 16” broke the top 10 on the Indigenous Music Countdown, and its accompanying music video landed her a spot in the top 12 of the Indigenous Music Awards’ Music Video Competition. Her song “Elijah” was also placed in Link to the Past Productions’ feature film, No Apology. \r\n\r\nA veteran of the stage, Jade began performing on stages in and around Alberta by the age of nine. She has performed at a multitude of venues including the Big Valley Jamboree, Tkaronto Music Festival, Nextfest and the Tim Horton’s Brier, and has also appeared as a vocalist for the Edmonton Pops Orchestra. An alumnus of RBCxMusic’s First Up Program and Indigenous Music’s Market Builder Residency, Jade possesses an impressive ability to move from ballads to bops with ease, and there is an authentic and grounded quality to her stage presence that creates an experience that is both electric and evocative.\r\n\r\nAlongside her career as a singer/songwriter, Kaeley Jade also works as an actor and visual artist; she holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree in Acting from the University of Alberta, and she is the current festival director for the 2021 Ukrainian Village Music Fest. She has composed music for several theatre and film productions, such as Theatre Calgary’s production of Romeo & Juliet, and she is set to work with Northern Light Theatre on the composition of a brand-new musical for their 2021/2022 season. Her ability to work in multiple disciplines charges her artistry with depth and fullness, which is evident in her latest single, “Painless.”\r\n\r\nProduced by the Juno-nominated team at Velveteen Music, “Painless”, dances through the nuclear fallout of a relationship gone awry. Both cynical and celebratory, “Painless” is filled to the brim with shimmering hooks, silky vocals and groovy riffs. “Painless” is now available on Spotify, Apple Music, and all other major digital streaming platforms.

2195	Kid Cali is as much an art project as it is a traditional rock band. The songs are all connected and centre around fictitious star- crossed lovers navigating the tail-end of the Summer of Love, searching for Kerouac’s American beauty, filtered through the lens of Easy Rider.\r\n\r\nThe lead single “Third Eye” was recorded to tape by Chris Dadge, featuring pedal steel remotely tracked by Dylan S Keating out of Montreal, and Del Monte and Mitch Cooper rounding out the rhythm section.\r\n\r\nKid Cali came to life during a three-week songwriter residency at the Banff Centre. Tory Rosso spent a few years on the road, playing sideman for storytelling folk singer, Tanner James, when they began designing a band for the digital age.\r\n\r\nThe band has performed live three times; once for the Prose and Pros category at the Ship and Anchor Song Contest finals, opening for Bobby Tenderloin Universe on the patio of Broken City and as a duo at the King Eddy, where Rachel Notley could be seen dancing up front. The project has since gained festival experiences at Big Winter Classic, Sled island and Lie Low festival. The live shows are built to incorporate ever changing band members, visual components and to never play the same way twice.

1688	"The Nico Tobias Band" are a bunch of classic rock lovin', outlaw country playin' fools from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Originally formed under the name "Abbey Rodeo", the four boys (Nico Tobias, Jordan Ast, Ty Coutu and James O'Neill) met at the Grant MacEwan University Music Program where they realized Jazz wasn't for them. Nico, who hails from the small mountain town of Canmore, had a catalog of catchy rock pop tunes that they recorded and started to play at every bar that would take them. The recordings where released on what is now called "The Abbey Rodeo EP", which was largely funded by Nico's home town who awarded him with an Emerging Artist Bursary in 2016. Yet as the boys got to know each other and got more comfortable in the Edmonton scene, their sound changed with their name. The first release as "The Nico Tobias Band" was "Anthracite", a grimy wink at Johnny Cash and Alberta history which won the 2018 Canadian Songwriting Competition for Canadiana. It became the first track on the band's 2019 album "No More Mr. Nico Guy" and it also redefined the music they were playing. Train Beat and Chicken Pickin' were here to stay, and the band found themselves as part of Edmonton's country music revival. "The Nico Tobias Band" kicked off 2020 as part of Exclaim!

519	Jess Knights is a Calgary soul-roots singer-songwriter with a renegade spirit and a luminous voice. Though she spent a decade cutting her teeth in dive bars belting out the blues, her debut full-length record, Best Kind of Light, set for release on June 19, 2020, is mostly rooted in revivalist soul. Recorded with award-winning producer Joshua Van Tassel and the crème de la crème of songsmiths and sidemen, including Donovan Woods, Joey Landreth, R. Grunwald, and others, the album brings into focus the moody, dimly-lit spectrum of her classically-trained voice, which has drawn comparisons to U.K. luminaries Amy Winehouse and Eliza Doolittle. Able to traverse sultry ballads and raise-the-roof-off-the-church soul with ease, this dynamo performer is bound to leave an impression.

1554	Randy Williams or "Geologist" is a multi-instrumentalist musician, vocalist, composer, producer, engineer. While he was a working musician, he acquired 6 degrees from the university of Alberta (Edmonton) and he was awarded the Mary Louise Imrie graduate student award (1998) for two limited edition albums he created in 1994 that promoted human rights. He achieved perfect grades during an Advanced Professional Certificate in Music Production at the Berklee College of Music (Boston) and was awarded a Phil Ramone Scholarship for the final course. During the week of January 5, 2015, Geologist had the DMDS 10th Most Active Indie streamed/downloaded Single not promoted to radio by any of the ‘major’ record companies.\r\nHe has released more than 200 songs among 14 albums and 44 singles (most as "Geologist", a couple of albums as "Randy Williams, Geologist", one of which was mixed by Barry Allen, and an album and several singles as, "Geologist, Jeanius and Sticks"). His 58 album covers demonstrate his oil painting, drawing and graphic artwork. Since 2010, he has produced, engineered and mastered music from his company’s studio. More recently in 2019, he has edited video to promote his release: “E.L.S.E._Love Somebody Else”.\r\n\r\nA member of CARAS and SOCAN, Randy is Avid Certified in Pro Tools. His performing name is a CIPO Registered Trademark: "Geologist", which appeared on his first two limited edition albums published in 1994 (which were only available from the CD Baby site) and all his wares and services since then. \r\nGeologist used the CD Baby Store site as his website until April 1, 2020 when CD Baby discontinued the store. \r\nAt present, Geologist’s music can be found on iTunes, as well as Amazon, Spotify and other streaming and downloading sites. Geologist did not release many of his works on streaming sites in the past and he has been reluctant to upload videos to YouTube that can be heard without being paid. Geologist dislikes social media sites, which he views as a waste of time.\r\n\r\nAn employee from his company is currently creating a music website for downloads, streams and his wares and services.  We were caught off-guard by CD Baby’s surprise decision to stop its online store sales one day after “Stay Home” was released on March 31, 2020, which is a renamed and remastered version of “Home: Gotta Get Away” from Geologist's “Neolithic Nights, Playing Politics” album.\r\nRandy Williams is from Edmonton. Because his music has been released from CD Baby with a US bar code since 2009, iTunes has not realized Geologist is a Canadian artist, despite the Canadian ISRCs.\r\nFor radio stations, Geologist’s music can be downloaded from DMDS.\r\n 	["music"]	[]	\N	\N	Randy Williams	7802886575	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1591779262/artist/1554/cover_photo.jpg	2020-06-10 08:47:52.231+00	2020-06-10 09:05:24.597+00	\N	\N	[{"index":0,"publicId":"artist/1554/hi-res/0.jpg","version":1591779403},{"index":1,"publicId":"artist/1554/hi-res/1.jpg","version":1591779665},{"index":2,"publicId":"artist/1554/hi-res/2.jpg","version":1591779923}]	[{"mediaType":"embeddedYoutube","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTVhYsWjiyc"},{"mediaType":"spotify","url":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/1Pjq8svmY4YMZmc6qM5zmz"},{"mediaType":"appleMusic","url":"https://music.apple.com/ca/album/neolithic-nights-playing-politics/1015830142"}]	Randy Williams is a multi-instrumentalist musician, vocalist, composer, producer, engineer. 	rock	["singer-songwriter","topforty"]	originals	\N	hTVhYsWjiyc	\N	\N	\N
1574	Drawing influence from pop, soul, and electronic music, X62 seamlessly blends together elements of each genre to create musically versatile and lyrically compelling songs. Consisting of Joel Toews and Sauvé (so-vay), X62 is influenced by Sam Smith, Emilié Sande, Brasstracks and NEEDTOBREATHE. Their gospel-tinged, optimistic sound is emphasized by backup vocals, dynamic horn lines and emotional complexity. Their lyrics toe the line between deeply personal and profoundly universal, inclining audiences to engage with both the duo’s live and recorded performances.\r\n\r\nX62’s newest single, “Nobody”, was released on April 24, 2020. In contrast to their previous singles, “Nobody” highlights the influence gospel music has on the group. “The song starts off sounding like a pop song,” says Sauvé, “but then halfway through we switch gears and bump up the whole song as we bring in a trumpet section and backup singers.”\r\n\r\n“For the back half of the song we wanted to change up the chords. We researched progressions from gospel artists such as Kirk Franklin or Elevation Collective and blended those ideas together to create a pop-gospel hybrid,” says Joel.\r\n\r\nAdditional production for the single was provided by Robbie Townsend (Talltale, Laur Elle) and the track was mixed by Brad Smith (JUNO-nominated Nuela Charles, iamhill). \r\n“Nobody” is the duos fourth single. Their previous singles, “Love Me Still” (2019) and “DOWN” (2018), gained X62 radio airplay on Mix107.9 (Ft. Saskatchewan, AB) and 102.3 NOW Radio (Edmonton, AB).\r\n\r\nWith an energizing and dynamic stage presence, the band toured in Ontario, CA in August 2019, performing at the Play in the Parks summer festival (Toronto). In April 2018, X62 placed first in the Students’ Association of MacEwan University showdown competition, leading to performances at the Kaleido Festival (Edmonton, AB, 2018) and MacEwan Fall Fest (Edmonton, AB, 2018). On top of writing and producing their own music, both Joel and Sauvé work as freelance composers for orchestra (Orchestra Borealis, University Symphony Orchestra), choir (Kokopelli Choir Association, Nuf Sed), film and theatre (“One Voice” & "The Ballad of Peachtree Rose").

1615	The transformation of nostalgia is both innovative and intricate, a delicate balance of appealing to the old while tiptoeing at the forefront of the entirely cutting edge. Unbound by any predisposed ideals around genre or delivery, trombonist Audrey Ochoa has achieved the ideal: presenting meticulously influential compositions with a playful and liberated approach.  \r\n\r\nClassically trained but with a voracious appetite for honing her craft in any genre, Ochoa has shared stages with Hilario Duran, PJ Perry, and Tommy Banks; and with international greats Lew Tebackin, Dan Akroyd and the Temptations. A rising star in her own right and a fixture of the Canadian music scene, she is decidedly captivating and original, and her compositional skill and talent on her instrument is spectacular. “...here shows a musician with endless confidence and skill, with varying moods and tempi within a trio that is always in sync.” - (Keith Black, Winnipeg Free Press)\r\n\r\nHer debut album, “Trombone and Other Delights” (2013) , was widely acclaimed and spent 3 consecutive weeks as the number one Jazz album on the Earshot charts. Ochoa’s sophomore release, “Afterthought” (2017), is an extension of her consummate understanding of arrangement and dedication to her craft - leading to a No. 1 position on the Canadian jazz charts and breaking top 20 in the U.S. She is a decorated award nominee, having earned recognition at the  Western Canadian Music Awards, the Global Music Awards and a recent recipient of the Edmonton Music Prize, noting an outstanding musical contribution to the local arts scene.\r\n\r\nWith significant education, performances and momentum amassed, Ochoa’s next recorded efforts were originally intended to feature duets with pianist Chris Andrew – which would be remixed by electronica DJ, Battery Poacher. As pre-production progressed, she found herself utilizing skills from other projects and arranging strings with horns and a rhythm section. The result is an ambitious project that introduces strings into her previous configuration of trombone, piano, bass and drums, a mix of chamber music with contemporary and Latin jazz. Focused on unique arrangements and undisputed inspirations, the album features electronic remixes alongside this harmonious combination of genres and ideals.\r\n\r\nExhilarating and exuberant, Audrey Ochoa exemplifies an artist who has dedicated herself to expertise while remaining relevant and light-hearted. With a magnificent and fresh-faced approach, she defies categorization and plants her flag firmly as a centrepiece of the Canadian music arena.

1579	Formed in 2013, with each release Elk Run + Riot have consistently built on their strength —three and four-part harmonies and a no-nonsense group mentality reminiscent of The Band.\r\nSince releasing their 3rd album, Animalia, in early 2018, Elk Run + Riot have been tearing up western Canada, and in the process winning over scores of new fans with their high-energy brand of alternative folk. From their home base in Alberta’s picturesque Bow Valley, the group’s creative core of Ryan Schepens (vocals/guitar), Andrew Cotter (vocals/bass/guitar), Brian Bailey (mandolin/bass) have wowed audiences at the Wapiti Music Festival, Invermere Music Festival, Canmore Folk Music Festival, and Banff Shaw Amphitheatre’s Canadian Roots Music Celebration, while sharing stages with Wintersleep, The Dead South, The Sadies, The Deep Dark Woods, Elliott Brood, Leeroy Stagger, and many more.\r\nElk Run + Riot’s 4th full-length album ​Morning Light​ was released on January 31st, 2020. The band wrote ​Morning Light i​n one night in a cabin in Golden, BC, after going on a songwriting retreat for a night to come up with new material and ending up with enough songs for an entire album! ​Morning Light was recorded at Studio D in Calgary, Alberta by Steve Dierkens, who co-produced the album with Elk Run + Riot.\r\nMorning Light​ touches on things like addiction, love/friends lost, growing up, the many times they’ve been crammed in the back of a Dodge Caravan (The Manatee Van) for weeks and months at a time just trying to make a name for themselves, and much more.

1369	Carter & the Capitals are a high energy five-piece funk group from Edmonton, Alberta. Known for their signature, hard-driving sound, soulful vocals, and catchy instrumental riffs, the Capitals fuse the most danceable elements of the pop and funk genres. By bottling up deep grooves from their wide range of influences and combining them with tight, snappy arrangements, the band offers its own unique take on Western Canadian funk.\r\n\r\nThis past year, the Capitals have been hard at work in Vancouver recording their debut full-length album with Juno Award winning producer/mixer Ben Kaplan (Five Alarm Funk, Mother Mother). This brand new self-titled record highlights the bands’ musicianship and impressive groove while exploring their growth as songwriters. The first two singles off of the album tap into both sides of the Capitals’ sound, from a hard driving, fun- rock influence featured in “Good Try” to a softer, synth pop sound shown in “One Step from Magic”.  Their new release truly sets Carter & the Capitals apart from the crowd but lets everybody know, the party is just getting started.\r\n	["music"]	[]	Mid-20s and older lovers of funk / soul 	\N	Lindon Carter	250 886 1275	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1582648911/artist/1369/cover_photo.jpg	2019-11-06 20:03:30.172+00	2020-06-10 20:46:03.614+00	\N	[{"name":"K-Days Main Stage (Edmonton)","date":"2019/07"},{"name":"Wapiti Festival (Fernie)","date":"2018/07"},{"name":"Festival du Voyageur (Winnipeg) ","date":"2020/02"}]	[{"index":0,"publicId":"artist/1369/hi-res/0.jpg","version":1582649209},{"index":1,"publicId":"artist/1369/hi-res/1.jpg","version":1582649569},{"index":2,"publicId":"artist/1369/hi-res/2.jpg","version":1591820899}]	[{"mediaType":"embeddedYoutube","url":"https://youtu.be/-TUfVSlG6cU"},{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/carterandthecapitals"},{"mediaType":"twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/Candthecapitals"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/carterandthecapitals/"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"https://www.carterandthecapitals.com/epk"},{"mediaType":"youtubeChannel","url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiVV00b4bzlq7UlS5rwwKEg"},{"mediaType":"vimeo","url":"https://vimeo.com/372544352"},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://carterandthecapitals.bandcamp.com/track/one-step-from-magic","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"829123965"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://carterandthecapitals.bandcamp.com/track/good-try","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"514185182"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://carterandthecapitals.bandcamp.com/track/youre-my-friend-feat-stephanie-french","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"314567898"}}]	Carter & the Capitals are a high energy five-piece funk group from Edmonton, Alberta.

Rather than being impressionists of master/classic artists of the genre, SiR has a modern sound and seeks to innovate and contemporize a musical form they love. Canadian Musician Magazine elaborates; “smooth, soulful grooves, melody lines that stay in your head and polished vocals”, SiR’s music proudly pays homage to tradition, while at the same time expanding boundaries.\r\n\r\n"Souls in Rhythm has found a unique niche somewhere between the pop radio crowd and the folk and roots scene, with songs as influenced as prominently by Prince and Michael Jackson as Al Green and Jerry Lee Lewis." - The Edmonton Sun\r\n\r\nSouls in Rhythm is: Scott Henderson (keys/vocals)Caleb Roddick (bass), Spencer Cheyne (drums) and Vincent Bundick (guitar).\r\n\r\n"SiR is a funk to get in to...R&B act is the real deal" - Calgary Sun\r\n\r\nWith a live show that delivers “hard-hitting bass, rhythmic guitar, rock-solid drums and dancing keys, all welded together with Henderson’s polished vocals” (Kamloops This Week), SiR will make you feel its music, inevitably ending with the people shaking it on the dance floor!\r\n\r\n	["music"]	[]	Souls in Rhythm has a wide demographic and is equally comfortable performing at theatres, clubs, universities and festivals - and regularly plays all of these.

The electro rock project continues to combine comic themes and the supernatural with their music and comic book series sold in stores across North America.

1926	Growing up Kate was drawn to country music at an early age.  She idolized Terri Clark, Leann Rimes, Shania Twain, Dolly Parton, and Reba, and would serenade the neighbors from her backyard swing set with her own renditions of any and every song they would listen too.  She began her musical journey with piano and continued into high school where she was part of many school bands and vocal groups, and began to teach herself guitar so she could learn all of Taylor Swift's songs. Kate began performing all over her home town and northern communities with a mix of covers and original songs.  Kate traveled to Vancouver to audition for Canada's Got Talent after high school, had opportunity to play the Red Piano in Edmonton, and performed and placed yearly in the Yukon's Superstar Rendezvous Event. \r\nKate took each opportunity to grow as an artist. She moved to Saskatchewan to pursue an education in her second passion, agriculture, then on to Alberta for work opportunity.  The past year has been astronomical for Kate's music career. She found her passion again and began recording her songs and finding her sound. She has had the opportunity to work with industry professionals in Nashville and Alberta, including Stephen Shiveley, Charlotte Avenue Entertainment, Jordan Craig, and Grant Howarth, and released her first single and music video for "Numb" March of 2021.  She was nominated for the YYC Prophets of Music Emerging Artist Award for 2021, and is set to release her debut EP within the following months. \r\nHer plans for the next year include to finish her album and hit the stage as much as possible. Kate looks forward to travelling to Nashville to continue her work with industry connections she's made thus far. \r\n	["music"]	[]		\N	Katelyn	403-878-6919	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1629926054/artist/1926/cover_photo.jpg	2021-08-25 21:10:39.77+00	2022-09-07 21:35:27.159+00	\N	[]	[{"index":0,"publicId":"artist/1926/hi-res/0.jpg","version":1629926109},{"index":1,"publicId":"artist/1926/hi-res/1.jpg","version":1629926140}]	[{"mediaType":"embeddedYoutube","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv4-gnuO5Sw"},{"mediaType":"youtubeChannel","url":"https://www.youtube.com/user/KatelynB54"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/katereidmusic/"},{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/katereidmusic1"},{"mediaType":"appleMusic","url":"https://music.apple.com/ca/artist/kate-reid/1555520501"}]	Kate Reid is originally from the Yukon, and has taken her love for country music and songwriting with her to her new home of Calgary.

1608	Born from mud, fire, and moon, Night Howl is a unique five-piece band from Edmonton, Alberta.\r\n\r\nFolk-rock is merged with orchestral strings, swing, and Latin flare, laced with screaming electric guitar, and soaked in a fine whiskey. Sung-from-the-guts vocals tell poetic stories of passion, partying, and tales from the darker corners of human nature.   \r\n\r\nNight Howl’s dance-floor shaking, sing-along party anthems are woven together with soaring cello melodies, blazing trumpet solos, and dynamics that will pierce your soul. They pull inspiration from those all-night campfire jams under a summer moon, from that feeling in the hips induced by a catchy Latin beat, or from the dark tales that creep out from a moonless night.

1815	I am known for being a World class performing artist, Master cultural teaching artist and Instrument maker in the realm of the ancient music of the Americas. My special emphasis is on the music of Ancient Mexico, which is my heritage. I also play what you might call "ancient/traditional/ceremonial music". I am also a modern composer and I reflect the sounds and experiences that formed who I am.\r\nThe ELECTRA AZTECA project allows me to go beyond the traditional and explore! I mix the sounds of the ancient flutes and drums of my ancestors with elements of "electronica" like ambient, dubstep, chill, drum n' bass, world music influences, latin music and fusion jazz.

1582	Harold was born and raised in Alberta Canada.  He is easily seen at many venues in and around Edmonton, Fort Saskatchewan and Sherwood Park.\r\nHe is currently enjoying a renaissance of sorts as the great songs he grew up listening to in small town Alberta seem to be more popular than ever.  You can hear those country, rock and blues influences in his original works.  His debut CD “Follow My Heart” has flavors from all these influences and can be heard on the local radio station or purchased from Itunes, Spotify and all digital download sites.\r\nHarold toured Alberta and BC in a band called Cross Country from early 1978 to late in 1979.  He took a lengthy hiatus to pursue a trade and raise a family but his passion for music always stayed close to his heart.\r\nHarold was a finalist in the 2019 Edmonton Blues Society Memphis Bound Challenge.\r\nHarold has come a long way from the wide eyed 5 year old opening his first Sears guitar on Christmas morning to where he is now.  You can easily hear how the years have honed his craft. \r\n\r\nThe Beatles, Elvis, Eric Clapton as well as country greats like Don Williams have absolutely defined his style. Artistically he refuses to cover songs note for note.  Rather, opting to play them respecting the original, but adding his own unmistakable style.   Especially in his guitar solos.\r\n	["music"]	[]	\N	\N	Maxine Reichstein	7809952312 	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1591895251/artist/1582/cover_photo.jpg	2020-06-11 17:06:43.11+00	2020-06-11 21:13:54.36+00	\N	\N	[{"index":0,"publicId":"artist/1582/hi-res/0.jpg","version":1591895668},{"index":1,"publicId":"artist/1582/hi-res/1.jpg","version":1591895811},{"index":2,"publicId":"artist/1582/hi-res/2.jpg","version":1591895839}]	[{"mediaType":"embeddedYoutube","url":"https://youtu.be/MWqr5AIUOT4"},{"mediaType":"youtubeChannel","url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyhag_I65MC763VAOmNzz3g"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"https://www.haroldsmusic.com/"},{"mediaType":"bandcampArtist","url":"https://haroldreichstein.bandcamp.com/"},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://haroldreichstein.bandcamp.com/track/broken-toys","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"474839834"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://haroldreichstein.bandcamp.com/track/take-me-muddy-river","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"2475629462"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://haroldreichstein.bandcamp.com/track/all-stays-the-same","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"138076452"}}]	Old school yet progressive solo artist , performing originals and covers. 	classic-rock	["blues","country"]	originals	\N	MWqr5AIUOT4	\N	\N	\N
1609	Nice Horse is wild: wildly talented, wildly entertaining, fun, fresh, fierce and feisty, and they’ve established themselves as one of the most buzzed-about and fast-rising groups in the Canadian music industry. A live act to be reckoned with, the self-contained all-female group has played high-profile festivals across Canada including Boots & Hearts, Big Valley Jamboree, and Dauphin’s CountryFest, and has performed in Spain and France. They have also toured as direct support for legendary artists \r\nsuch as Tom Cochrane and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. The band, made up of Katie Rox (vocals/banjo/acoustic guitar), Brandi Sidoryk (vocals/bass), Tara McLeod (electric guitar), and Krista Wodelet (vocals/drums), has garnered significant accolades in their four short years together, including two CCMA nominations, the 2018 YYC Music Award for Country Recording of the Year, and the 2019 Alberta Country Music Award for Group of the Year.

1603	Hermitess is the solo project of songwriter, visual artist and harpist Jennifer Crighton. Dreaming simultaneously in music and images, her projects are often approached with the sensibility of curator, intent on a carefully imagined collection of collaborators, stories and set pieces. Sonically, layered orchestral textures, choral voices, and pedal driven magic conjuring a fever dream. \r\n\r\nDelicate harp lines loop and tangle into an intricate latticework of rhythm and melody, while unfamiliar sounds and unplaceable textures enrich the arrangements. Over this sonic foundation, Crighton sings in the voice of her adopted character, the words part story and part incantation. The lyrics question and caution the listener, walking the line between dreams and nightmares.\r\n	["music"]	[]		\N	Jennifer Crighton	4034779863	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1591999961/artist/1603/cover_photo.jpg	2020-06-12 22:10:31.122+00	2020-06-12 22:25:14.573+00	\N	[{"name":"Studio Bell, National Music Center ","date":"2018/09"},{"name":"Amigos Cantina, FemmeFest","date":"2019/03"},{"name":"Legion #1, Sled Island Music and Arts Festival","date":"2019/05"}]	[{"index":0,"publicId":"artist/1603/hi-res/0.jpg","version":1591999986},{"index":1,"publicId":"artist/1603/hi-res/1.jpg","version":1592000001},{"index":2,"publicId":"artist/1603/hi-res/2.jpg","version":1592000043}]	[{"mediaType":"embeddedYoutube","url":"https://youtu.be/I8uKp1jO3YU"},{"mediaType":"youtubeChannel","url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgSZw8ToR6fW4prcFCHajEA/"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/_hermitess_/"},{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/The.Hermitesss/"},{"mediaType":"twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/_hermitess_"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"http://www.hermitess.band"},{"mediaType":"spotify","url":"https://open.spotify.com/album/2PKN7kbNsApr4mEPZNaXSk"},{"mediaType":"bandcampArtist","url":"https://hermitess.bandcamp.com/releases"},{"mediaType":"appleMusic","url":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/hermitess/1233533649"},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://hermitess.bandcamp.com/track/blood-moon","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"1041251348"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://hermitess.bandcamp.com/track/animal-heart","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"3211271665"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://hermitess.bandcamp.com/track/hush","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"1112722157"}}]	Delicate harp lines loop and tangle into an intricate latticework of rhythm and melody.	pop	["alternative","ambient"]	originals	\N	I8uKp1jO3YU	\N	\N	\N

1585	SHAG originated in the shag carpeted basement where Trevor, Jess and Travis first started jamming in their early university years, then Zack joined the group in late 2014 and added a whole new dimension to the band. SHAG started to hit the live local scene in Edmonton and surrounding area and built up their following and made some new local music pals. SHAG then recorded and released their first EP "SHAG Reinvent's Music" in May of 2016.\r\n\r\n​Two years later, SHAG has recorded their first full length album "Thursday Night Special" at Royal Studio in Edmonton and released the album in June of 2018. The lead single "Do Better" gained popularity and scored some local radio airplay and the full album was well-received by fans and critics!\r\n\r\nSHAG's follow up to 2018's "Thursday Night Special" picks up right where that one left off. Their second EP released from the frozen prairies of Canada: "All Supply, No Demand" was released on October 17, 2019. \r\n\r\nSHAG has shared the stage with other great Canadian bands like Captain Tractor, Current Swell, Altameda, Weaves and Girlfriend Material.

2291	No matter what genre you listen to, you’ll find a groove in my tracks that matches your vibe. My musical influences are in constant flux; one week it’s Afrobeats, UK Grime, and the next is R&B, melodic Rap, 90s Hip-Hop, and Trap. You’ll get a taste of Nigerian sound sprinkled into smooth pop when you listen to Lover Boy music. My genre, although regularly touching on different inspirations, is soulful Pop, Alternative R&B, smooth Rap and experimental Hip-Hop. \r\n\r\nAt the core, I create music that soothes the spirit. With a focus on connecting with my listeners mentally, songwriting and production are my tools of exploration, and along with my fans, I rhythmically and lyrically navigate different perspectives on growth.\r\n\r\nFostering a deeper connection is a by-product of what I put into my music. I treat every music project as a journey within myself, as well as a collective journey with the producers, videographers, graphic designers and models that I work with, on top of creating a journey for the listeners to take part in when the project is released. \r\n\r\nI have a need for a challenge when it comes to making music, everything I do builds my artistic muscle. I build people up like Lady Leshurr, spread positivity within my community like Burna Boy, and serve up motivation with my collaborators and fans like Big K.R.I.T. My goal is to get into your playlist and into your heart.

1655	You never know quite what’s around the next corner or the next chord change when you take a sonic trip with Sargeant X Comrade. Yolanda Sargeant’s rich, smoky vocals – playful or melancholy, joyful or pensive – come in over top of a fresh and unexpected mixture of elements in each song. Sometimes it’s ‘40s swing piano riffs tinkling over a languid hip hop beat. Sometimes it’s haunting flamenco guitar mixed with reggae styles blended with soulful trip hop. Always, it’s distinctive and fascinating. Always, you can bet on it to draw you in.\r\n\r\nSargeant’s vocal style infuses inspirations like Billie Holiday, Nina Simone and Erykah Badu into a style entirely her own. It comes together with the sonic architecture of producer Evgeniy a.k.a. Comrade a.k.a. White Russian Production, to form a sound that is exciting and challenging, featuring unexpected and captivating juxtapositions of elements and genres.

796	Heavy hitting drums and songs full of emotion, The Sweets take you down the rabbit hole with their blend of indie-pop/sludgy psych-rock. Deep down, somewhere in soft part of your belly, you crave  an instant to let your head hang, letting raw velvety vocals and yearning guitar tones take you on a warm fuzzy trip. So when The Sweets bring their show to the stage, you’re lured in by sounds from dreams of wild things but it’s their stage presence that steals your heart. \r\n\r\nWith their inception in 2014, The Sweets have established a steady presence and sonority of their own. They’ve been compared to bands from Fleetwood Mac and Patti Smith to Queens of the Stone Age and Metric. Over the course of their career, they have shared the stage with acts such as The Pack AD, Chad Vangaalen, Counterfeit Jeans and Scenic Route to Alaska and are a familiar sight on many of Calgary’s stages and festivals.The Sweets released their debut EP in 2016 and a summer single in 2017. Currently they are working on new material to record and hone thier sound. Their live show is infectious; a feverish call to the rock n roll animals in the forest. A true group of eclectics, The Sweets will continue to enchant the sweaty masses where ever they go, even if it’s just for the night.\r\n	["music"]	[]	teens, 30 +, Adults	\N	Claudia Tomczyk	5877007520	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1592425305/artist/796/cover_photo.jpg	2018-09-25 01:59:21.842+00	2020-06-24 00:18:41.921+00	In Calgary.

1599	Raised in Peterborough, Ontario, singer-songwriter Dave McCann rolled west and landed in Calgary, Alberta during the first Alt-Country inclination of the late 1990’s. He founded Dave McCann and the Ten Toed Frogs and released a string of critically acclaimed projects - “Woodland Tea”, “Country Medicine”, and “Shoot the Horse” (a live capture at the historic Sidetrack Cafe, one of Alberta’s fondest and long gone venues). In 2009, he followed the road south to East Nashville to record with Lij Shaw and Americana guitar icon and producer Will Kimbrough (Emmylou Harris, Rodney Crowell, Mavis Staples, Todd Snider). The resulting work “Dixiebluebird” brought a name change and was an inspiring benchmark release for Dave McCann and the Firehearts. He made a move south from Calgary to Lethbridge, Alberta to get married and raise a family and, in 2014, conspired with fellow Southern Albertan Leeroy Stagger at his Rebeltone Ranch to build the “Circle of Light” release. After close to two decades, Dave McCann has locked himself firmly into hearts and minds of the Alberta music scene as one of the best untold singer-songwriters working in contemporary roots music. His newest effort “Westbound ’til Light” is no exception. This is an unyielding collection of songs - story songs, train songs, disaster songs, and message songs - all informed by some aspect of North American folklore. It’s definitive roots music, steeped in Dave’s unique vision and story based narrative.

1617	Baritone Madness was formed by Pat Belliveau, Keith O’Rourke, and Gareth Bane to bring the magic of the baritone saxophone to jazz audiences. Baritone Madness is a highly unique configuration; a quintet comprised of three baritone saxophonists as leads, supported by a rhythm section of double bass and drums. These players have captivated audiences through their inventive originals and thoughful arrangements of music by Gerry Mulligan, Pepper Adams and Hamiett Bluiett that complement the low range of the baritone sax. As a group they have been playing together for enthusiastic audiences since they began in February of 2016. In 2019, they took to the road to share their new music with fans at Montreal International Jazz Festival, TD Ottawa Jazz Festival and TD Edmonton International Jazz Festival. Their self-titled album, was released on September 13, 2019. It debuted at #1 on Canadian jazz radio and held the spot for 3 months straight – landing at #5 for the 2019 year, hit #7 in the US, and has garnered rave reviews across North America.\r\n\r\nHighlights:\r\n\r\n- 2019 summer tour to jazz festivals, Canada Council supported – Montreal, Ottawa, Edmonton\r\n- Album release September 2019 on Chronograph Records\r\n- Radio chart debut at #1 in Canada, held the #1 spot for 3 months straight \r\n- #5 on Canadian jazz radio charts for the 2019 year \r\n- Hit #7 in the US on the campus jazz charts \r\n- Earned excellent reviews in Le Devoir (Montreal), New York City Jazz Record, Jazz Weekly, Art Music Lounge, Jersey Jazz, Ottawa Jazz Scene, and Wulf’s Music.\r\n	["music"]	[]		\N	Stephanie Hutchinson	5875839504	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1592259432/artist/1617/cover_photo.jpg	2020-06-15 20:13:48.734+00	2020-06-15 23:22:27.996+00	\N	[{"name":"Montreal International Jazz Festival","date":"2019/07"},{"name":"TD Ottawa International Jazz Festival","date":"2019/06"},{"name":"TD Edmonton International Jazz Festival","date":"2019/06"}]	[{"index":0,"publicId":"artist/1617/hi-res/0.jpg","version":1592259444},{"index":1,"publicId":"artist/1617/hi-res/1.png","version":1592259468}]	[{"mediaType":"embeddedYoutube","url":"https://youtu.be/yIgnLD90e34"},{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/BaritoneMadness/"},{"mediaType":"bandcampArtist","url":"https://baritonemadness.bandcamp.com"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"https://www.keithorourke.ca/baritone-madness"},{"mediaType":"spotify","url":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/3oD1zdwRMuVhg96RMnsAbX"},{"mediaType":"appleMusic","url":"https://music.apple.com/ca/album/baritone-madness/1474898973"},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://baritonemadness.bandcamp.com/track/moanin","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"1665797766"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://baritonemadness.bandcamp.com/track/port-nola","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"1304169132"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://baritonemadness.bandcamp.com/track/the-c-b-shuffle","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"1715132988"}}]	Unique baritone saxophone ensemble featuring some of Western Canada's top jazz musicians. 	jazz	["instrumental"]	originals	\N	yIgnLD90e34	839031218RT0001	\N	\N
1567	Emerging into the Calgary music scene in 2016, The Smallest One (Mason McConnell) writes, records, mixes and masters all of his own content. Though most comfortable in his bedroom studio producing somewhat sad, often quietly melodic synth-layered tracks, when brought out to venues, his live sets consist of sparse, simplistic renditions of his original songs - as well as a cover or two - utilizing only an acoustic guitar and his whispery vocals. He has collaborated with two fellow Calgary artists (one poet and one musician), both of which resulted in two separate 5-song EPs together, and one track ending up with its own stop-motion music video also filmed, edited, and produced by Mason. Always having a new project on the go, The Smallest One sees no end in sight regarding music production.

1798	 Jon MacAulay is no stranger to the stage despite being a new arrival on the scene in Western Canada. A product of the  Quebec countryside, Jon has been a staple of the province's music scene, boasting an eventful career spanning just over a decade. Back in QC, he shared the stage with the likes of Western Canadian favorites such as Brett Kissel and Dan Davidson among many other reknowned artists. As much a student of Dylan and Young as Kristofferson, Hendrix, and Wes Montgomery, MacAulay is a veritable sponge drawing inspiration from a wide array of genres to create his deeply heartfelt and honest music. \r\n\r\nSo far, Jon's recording career has produced an EP entitled "Solid Ground" (2015) and, most recently, a full-length album “What I’m Here” released in the fall of 2020.

1570	Currently, James and Sean are balancing working on their Bachelor of Music Degrees at MacEwan University, songwriting, recording and performing. Their original music has been described as “a unique Celtic rock sound” and as “beautiful harmonies and wonderful storytelling ballads that they perform with sheer musical talent and ability”. We hope you agree!\r\n\r\nKeyboards, Vocals and Production: James Morrison\r\nGuitar, Auxiliary Percussion and Vocals: Sean Morrison\r\n\r\nOur inspiration...\r\n\r\nLong before the conception of Mearon, brothers James and Sean had already experienced many incredible moments that can only be described as “interventions of fate” with their music. Many opportunities would not have been possible without a number of wonderful people who mentored, guided and supported Mearon. The brothers believe that it’s the human spirit in all its generosity, kindness and optimism that has formed their act and it’s these traits that continue to shape them. In turn, James and Sean strive to remind people of our shared human experience through emotion, beauty and powerful song.\r\n\r\nOf equal importance to the song is the performance. The brothers view performance as a communion of sorts, at which they risk vulnerability as they share their viewpoints, heartbreak and hope through song. They aim to spur positive discourse surrounding issues important to themselves and to society and always encourage people to practice human kindness.

363	Hailing from Montreal, Yves Gravel's sound is edgy, distilled, and raw. Yves first picked up the guitar at age 8 and at age 14 found a kindred spirit in Leonard Cohen - beginning a life long journey with Cohen's romantic, somber and avant-garde devotion to songwriting, poetry, and literature. Yves spent over a decade between Montreal, Vancouver and Kelowna exploring purist theology and philosophy before relocating to Alberta.  It was here that his desire for personal renaissance manifested into songwriting - resulting in bilingual Canadiana anthems of love, anguish and resolve. Yves has explored diverse genres and credits an open approach to collaboration with The Talent as the major source of influence for adopting new sounds. His personal playlist includes genres of folk, punk-rock, classical and electronic music. Yves currently resides in Calgary with his cat Leonard - where he devotes himself to an unapologetic life of wine, romance and the daily commute.  \r\n\r\n​	["music"]	["alternative","folk","singer-songwriter"]	Arts scene, indie music scene, Folk scene / 25 years old and up / Francophiles (secondary demographic)	\N	Yves	4034641801	ygravel@icloud.com	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1592595755/artist/363/cover_photo.png	2018-01-18 01:16:11.34+00	2020-06-19 22:24:48.354+00	 Anytime in the Calgary area and anywhere in Alberta with a month notice	[{"name":"Festival Hall - (LP Launch)","date":"2019/09"},{"name":"La Cité des Rocheuses (French Music Festival)","date":"2019/12"},{"name":"The Unicorn (Single Release)","date":"2018/01"}]	[{"index":0,"publicId":"artist/363/hi-res/0.jpg","version":1575057009},{"index":1,"publicId":"artist/363/hi-res/1.jpg","version":1575057045},{"index":2,"publicId":"artist/363/hi-res/2.jpg","version":1575057077}]	[{"mediaType":"embeddedYoutube","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8pP22OpLS0"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/yvesandthetalent"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"http://www.yvesandthetalent.com"},{"mediaType":"youtubeChannel","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxF0qYziaSI"},{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/YvesandTheTalent/"},{"mediaType":"spotify","url":"https://open.spotify.com/album/24q71pCd9WNFTLBkp0CbgV?si=xXggHcehTNaDQE5dumvKow"},{"mediaType":"appleMusic","url":"https://music.apple.com/ca/album/ambivalent-certainties/1498301893"},{"mediaType":"soundCloud","url":"https://soundcloud.com/yvesandthetalent"},{"mediaType":"bandcampArtist","url":"http://yvesandthetalent.bandcamp.com/album/ambivalent-certainties"},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"http://yvesandthetalent.bandcamp.com/album/ambivalent-certainties","metadata":{"type":"album","id":"2611657032"}}]	Indie-Prog-Orchestral musical project performing in English and French as a duo, trio or group.	alternative	["indie-rock"]	originals	\N	m8pP22OpLS0	\N	\N	\N

1908	FKB is a high-energy, four-piece, alternative rock band based in Edmonton, AB, influenced by the mystique, glamour, and excess of the 1960s-1980s entertainment business. \r\n\r\nFormed in Bonnyville, AB, the band is fronted by JUNO Award-nominated songwriter (2019), Drew Shalka, and also features Travis Topylki (lead guitar), Derek Chalut (drums), and Alex Fedorouk (rhythm guitar). \r\n\r\nFKB’s infectious, falsetto-driven single, “Glow” (2020), is co-produced by Dan Davidson (Tupelo Honey) and Clayton Bellamy (Road Hammers). “’Glow’ is us finding a way to connect our influences from the past, like The Beatles, Elvis Presley, and The Beach Boys, with the modern sounds of Foster The People, Portugal the Man and The Weeknd,” says Shalka. “We wanted to draw from the excitement our live shows and give people something they can dance to.” \r\n\r\nThe band appears as themselves in the feature film, Moments in Spacetime (Oct 2020), performing their single, “My Bedroom” (2018). “We reconnected with our high school media arts teacher at a local TEDx event where we were both speaking. He had returned from film school in Vancouver and his recent project, Sweet Oil (2017),  was featured at the Phoenix Film Festival and the Holly Shorts Film Festival (Hollywood).

1629	" Inspired by the beauty of the natural environments he has been living and working in over the past few years from Europe to Indonesia, a sense of awe permeates Kawchuk's tapestry of bright melodies, mournful strings, delicate piano, serene ambience and brooding drone — as sublime and dangerous as the weather and environments that move him musically." - MUTEK\r\n\r\nJonathan Kawchuk is a field recordist, sound artist, and composer from Canada. For his debut album, North (Paper Bag Records), all compositions were played back into the forests of Jostedal National Park, Norway, and re-recorded after reverberating around their natural surroundings.

1742	Jordan “JusJrdn” Pariseau is an independent, national award nominated hip hop artist from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. \r\nPrior to emerging as a solo artist, JusJrdn collaborated with Edmonton artists Angelo Gabe, and Karly Hope, performing as the trio ImPerfection. They cut their teeth and earned their dues performing at talent shows, fundraisers, weddings, birthday parties, and anywhere else they could plug in and bust out. \r\nJusJrdn began performing more shows as a solo act, developing his voice, and honing his performance style. In November 2015, JusJrdn collaborated on a 3-song project with producer Andrew Menzak, who was using it for his portfolio at MacEwan University, a collaboration that sparked 2016’s 14-track record “L.I.F.E.”. The album, featuring JusJrdn’s previous collaborators Karly Hope and Angelo Gabe, officially released on December 27th, 2016, and the official sold-out release party blew the walls off The Needle Vinyl Tavern in Edmonton. \r\nJusJrdn was nominated for both the People’s Choice Award for the 2017 Edmonton Music Awards as well as Prairie Rap Album of the year for the 2017 CUT Awards. Off the strength of the album JusJrdn continued to perform around Edmonton, opening for bigger acts such as R.A. The Rugged man,       A-F-R-O, Ace Hood, Vic Mensa, Tyga, as well as hosting Jay-Z’s 4:44 tour after-party. \r\nIn May of 2018, as JusJrdn was preparing to tour Europe, it all fell apart. Some business deals went chaotic, creating a ton of debt for JusJrdn. His girlfriend left, and JusJrdn faced the challenge of running his personal training Company F.R.E.E. Fitness, while struggling to pay off bills and find energy for his art. JusJrdn hit a wall. What followed was a period of isolation, depression and crippling anxiety. But after some time in isolation to heal and rejuvenate, reading and meditating daily, along with an intense workout and fasting schedule, JusJrdn found his way back to the light, better, faster, stronger. \r\nIn November 2019, JusJrdn dropped a set of singles called “Jus4Fun” to showcase his new, yet familiar, sound, his positive mindset, and his sky-high ambition. This is only the beginning.\r\nWith a new, bigger team behind him, JusJrdn puts the final touches on 2 new e.p's and his killer full-length studio record “Olympus” (scheduled to drop in 2021). These projects will feature Canada's best in the music industry collaborating with professionals in and out of the studio, as well as featured mixes from mixing master Nato who works the cloesly with fellow Canadian Artist Merkules. Aiming high is nothing new for JusJrdn. With personal goals clearly in his sights, JusJrdn is ready to break big, bringing his insane, high energy stage show to new audiences. With the support of his family and with the lessons of the street behind him, JusJrdn won’t take no for an answer anymore. \r\n\r\nNothing can stop J now.

2043	"Ryan is no stranger to music fans on the Jersey Shore and NYC. He’s built a solid fanbase and drawn comparisons to Springsteen in both solo performances and with his high-energy band Nick Ryan and the Mess.” - Rob Dye (American Songwriter Magazine)\r\n\r\nWith a sound ranging from the “heartland rock” of Asbury Park, “Memphis soul”, and modern pop, there’s a taste of familiarity with a fresh originality with Nick Ryan and the Mess. As a must see live band, the six-piece rock band takes charge of the stage in the likeness of Bruce, Prince, and Jagger, engaging their audience to a new level. The chemistry between all the members makes you feel as if you're in the band yourself, making a point to cater to audiences of all sizes.\r\n\r\nThe band consists of Ryan (lead vocals, guitar), Jimmy Franklin (lead guitar, backing vocals), Lucas Perez (saxophone), Robbie Sko (keyboards), Jorden Bowen (drums, backing vocals) and Julian Michalski (bass guitar, backing vocals). Each of the members have been veterans to the New Jersey music scene and beyond for the last decade, playing world tours, stadiums and having videos on MTV. Through three short years, Nick Ryan and the Mess has made plenty noise of their own, with a video premiered through American Songwriter Magazine, releasing three songs on all streaming platforms and playing a couple hundred high energy shows.\r\n\r\n Their momentum continues in 2022 with a weekly residency at the famous Nardi's in Long Beach Island, hundreds of gigs all over the east coast and more music and videos on the way.

815	Born out of a shared love of surf culture, tattoos, motorcycles, and hot rods, Rob Day and Chris van Keir created The 427’s as a throwback to days spent at the beach and nights spent on the strip. Formed in 2013 and influenced by early '60s surf music, spaghetti westerns, and film noir, The 427’s released their debut EP, “Surf Noir” in 2014, which was nominated for “Instrumental Recording of the Year” at the Western Canadian Music Awards. After having their music featured in mountain biking, snowboarding, and surfing documentaries, the band self-released their debut full-length, “Mavericks”, which spent seven weeks on the !earshot National Top 50 charts, including two weeks in the Top 20. In 2016, in continuing to expand their sound and vision, they brought bassist Eve Hell and drummer Wrayne Ramone into the fold and won a local award for best live show. After providing the soundtrack to a Maclean's magazine feature on river-surfing and spending much of late-2017 writing and recording, the band has now released their second full-length album, "Stay Gold", which was recorded at Public Lunch Studios in Calgary, Alberta and mixed by Dallas Good of The Sadies. As Slams Reviews states, "It's smart and sexy surf that will definitely colour you impressed. Highly recommended."

2166	Alberta’s Renegade Station has embarked on a dynamic musical journey that sees the talented quartet elevating their already impressive reputation for creative excellence and superior showmanship to new heights.  \r\n\r\nSometimes, when friends come together to create something, magic happens. That is exactly what happened when friends Kent Nixon, Russ and Luanne Carl, and Scott Mcknight came together to form the award winning band, Renegade Station. \r\n\r\nWhat started out as being a backup band for a local variety show, they quickly learned that they had something special and that they had a chemistry that needed to be expanded upon. They started taking gigs for anything they could. Weddings, ball tournaments, and curling bonspiels. This turned out to be an amazing way to cut their teeth in the Alberta music industry, and gave them the experience they needed to take that next step to the next level. \r\n\r\nIn 2013 they signed on with Sirroma Entertainment to take their career to the next level. Releasing radio singles, and touring and promoting those singles across Canada, Renegade Station soon proved to industry and fans alike that they were to be an important part of the Canadian Country Music Scene. \r\n\r\nTheir radio singles have garnered them much attention, and includes their Top 50 hit “Who’s Gonna Love Me Tonight” which also won them the inaugural Single of the Year award at the 2019 Country Music Alberta Awards. They also took home Group of the Year for 2015 and 2016, and the highly coveted Fans Choice Award in 2015. In 2016 Luanne was also nominated for a Canadian Country Music Award for Bass Player of the Year.  \r\n\r\nRenegade Station is well known for their incredible harmonies, which has had them compared to Little Big Town, Fleetwood Mac and Lady A. That is what first drew them together, was their harmonies, and it is what continues to keep them together. That undeniable chemistry. Their energetic stage show always leaves fans wanting more.

The four-piece band was formed in 2016 by lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Cassidy Rain & lead guitarist Bryan Schroeder. As a singer, Cassidy has been compared to Bonnie Raitt and Susan Tedeschi but her raw sensibility as front person could as easily bring comparisons to blues legends like Howlin Wolf or Muddy Waters.  Bryan’s playing falls somewhere between Duane Allman and Derek Trucks, as many fans have pointed out.

1677	A childhood steeped in church music in small town Alberta gave Enslen a solid technical base upon which he has explored all kinds of musical traditions. In particular, he was drawn to songs that are common to folk in the rural prairies, the kind of country music that is born of bar room storytelling. A shifting home base - Medicine Hat, Victoria, Winnipeg, and now Calgary - helped grow his practice, pushed him to find a contemporary footing for his songwriting. Along the way, Enslen’s music has taken him across North America, offering his steady-going guitar playing and heartfelt lyrics to audiences of all stripes. Those same audiences have provided countless moments of inspiration and stories of their own that feed this guitar-picking, sweetly-singing machine.

932	Laura Hickli (Mohkínstsis/Calgary) is an internationally touring baroque pop songstress known for her dreamy, tightly-arranged soundscapes, exquisite vocals, evocative lyrics and her emotionally powerful performances. A classically trained pianist and member in several award-winning musical projects including Carla J. Easton and 36?, Hickli’s latest material has struck a spellbinding balance of spectral intimacy and bombast explosivity. Described as ‘indomitable,’ Laura Hickli will shatter any expectations of the way a piano should be played, a voice should be lifted, or a life should be lived.\r\n\r\n'Unholy Power', her latest release on Montana’s North Pole Records, is the lead single off of Laura Hickli’s new record “Both Feet in the World, At Least I Can Stand”. Since it's recent release it has received radio play on several major radio stations including BBC and CBC and was added to several official Spotify playlists including Canada's Official Exclaim Eh! List. In 'Unholy Power' Hickli's unique ancient hymnal and classical roots meet her art-rock/baroque-pop appetite, further elevating her latest sound with pristine experimental production in the likes of Weyes Blood, Lana Del Ray and Phoebe Bridgers whilst nailing the sincerity and attitude of iconic artists like Kate Bush, Bjork and Fiona Apple.

1644	Tracy Millar comes from a world far away from those where an artist’s career is shaped by the myriad of variables, the music business insists are necessary to drive a musicians career. A rural Alberta gal, Tracy has always been passionate about music and contributing to her community. And passionate with a capital “P”, as this recording artist never gives less than 100% of her heart, and God-given talents to any project or performance.\r\nAll this wouldn’t carry much weight if Tracy Millar’s efforts over the last decade had landed on deaf ears and indifferent audiences. But the fact is Millar has been winning over the public and peers with a pure voice coming out of the country tradition, and songs resonating with audiences possibly hearing her for the 1st time or 10th time. \r\nAs an accomplished performer Tracy has shared the stage with some of North America’s biggest stars; Tanya Tucker , Keith Urban, Tim McGraw, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band , Brett Kissel, Clayton Bellamy just to name a few.  Despite taking a few years off from recording Tracy never stopped performing, often being asked to return to Rodeos, Annual Corporate Events and Alberta Festivals. Tracy has been a long time member of the Ian Tyson “The Gift” tribute a performance by former members of Ian Tyson’s Band as well as featuring Artists such as Corb Lund. Whether it’s the main stage of Big Valley Jamboree, or the Songwriters stage at Trac on 2, Tracy’s genuine love of people, her humble spirit and cheeky wit come together with her pure talent delighting her fans and always making new ones.

1587	It’s said the cells in your body replace themselves every decade or so. After 11 albums, two EPs and 17  years as a singer-songwriter, Leeroy Stagger has been wondering if maybe the soul works the same way. Ten years sober, with two kids, a home in Lethbridge and a world-class recording studio to go with it, he’s far removed from the hard-living twenty-something who started on this musical path. As far as Stagger can see, they aren’t even the same person.\r\n\r\nStrange Path is the name of Stagger’s newest album and book, a name that applies as much to his unexpected route from the BC punk scene to southern-Alberta singer-songwriter as it does to the album’s own evolution. Following from 2017’s Love Versus, itself a creative re-emergence after a years-long fog of anxiety and depression, Strange Path is the end result of a triple-album’s worth of scrapped demos, record label rejections, and a spirit-reviving retreat inwards. It’s also Stagger’s most ambitious and philosophical creation yet, a veritable self-help book pulled from a lifetime of struggling towards the light and brimming with the hard-won joy at the heart of his recent renaissance. \r\n\r\nFrom the appropriately haunted “Leonard Cohen is Dead” and the cosmic reflections of album-closer “The Light” to the hard-edged stomp of “Jesus and Buddha” and glam-rock bliss of “Strange Attractor,” it’s an album of sharp hooks and sharper insights, a statement on loss, forgiveness, pain, faith, The Clash, Gord Downie, love, death, fear, letting go, higher powers, Mother Earth, obsession, redemption, and the path we all walk through life.\r\n\r\nExploring all that terrain takes one monster of a band. To piece it together, Stagger surrounded himself with some of the best players in the business. The first step was enlisting “Love Versus” drummer Pete Thomas (Elvis Costello and the Attractions, Elliot Smith, Los Lobos) to once again lend his meticulous musicianship to the mix. If anyone could navigate the heady themes Stagger was charting, it’s the man Tom Waits once called the best rock drummer in the world. Longtime collaborator Tyson Maiko stepped in on bass, with Paul Rigby (Neko Case, Garth Hudson, Jakob Dylan) joining on guitar, and Stagger’s touring band, the Rebeltone Sound (Ryland Moranz on guitar, mandolin and vocals, and Michael Ayotte on piano, synthesizers and keyboards) rounding out the arrangements.\r\n\r\nProduction duties were trickier to pin down. Brad Barr of the acclaimed act The Barr Brothers shared the helm on four of the eleven tracks. That left Stagger, a veteran producer of other artist’s albums, to steer his own ship for the first time. Self-producing took a more methodical and patient approach than the shoot-from-the-hip style Stagger usually preferred. Then it was turned over for mixing by 5 time Grammy winner Ryan Freeland (Ray Lamontagne, Bonnie Raitt, Aimee Mann, Rodney Crowell and more). It turned out to be a blessing, though, another insight gained on the long road to Strange Path. \r\n\r\nOf course, there’s no path so long without a fork or two along the way, and one of the roads-not-travelled on the way to the album turned out too tempting to abandon. Released on May 17th, Me and the Mountain is a companion piece to Strange Path, an Americana-influenced counterpart to Strange Path’s contemporary sound. Featuring guitar wizard Steve Dawson (Zubot and Dawson), and award-winning multi-instrumentalist Steve Marriner alongside Stagger and Rigby as well as Barr, the album shows yet\r\nanother facet of Leeroy Stagger’s ongoing musical reflections.\r\n\r\nFollowing up a career-redefining album like Love Versus is no small task. Strange Path and Me and the Mountain prove Stagger is more than up to the challenge. Bristling with love, grit, and confidence, they show the singer, songwriter, producer and performer at his best. He’s stared down his past, retraced his steps, reflected on the beauty and pain of a life that’s had more than its share of both. Maybe he’s not the same person he was 10 years ago, but if anything, Leeroy Stagger is more himself than ever.\r\n\r\nStrange Path the book will be out at the same time as the album. It is described as an artists’ path through trauma, healing and music and finding self-purpose through the art that this work entails.

629	Soaked in the bright psychedelia of the 1960’s and dipped in the indie rock explosion of the new millennium, The Velveteins are best described as a bridge between the two. Inspired after living out of a camper van on the beaches of Australia for a year frontman Spencer Morphy returned to Canada and started the band with co-songwriter Addison Hiller in 2014. The duo wrote five songs in two weeks and scraped together enough cash to fly to Nashville and record their first EP with producer Lincoln Parish of Cage The Elephant. Afterwards they wasted no time cramming into a Pontiac Montana with new found bassist Dean Kheroufi and touring across the country. This was the beginning of their vigorous touring schedule which led to international appearances (SXSW, and the Great Escape) and opening slots for established acts including Wolf Parade, Elephant Stone, and July Talk. All this caught the attention of indie label Fierce Panda in April of 2016 the band's first EP ‘A Hot Second with the Velveteins’ was released.

1666	Since 2008, Lab Coast has been delivering hazy bursts of hook-laden guitar pop via a string of critically-acclaimed, award-winning albums, EPs, and singles. From their basement studio in Calgary, Alberta, the songwriting team of singer David Laing & multi-instrumentalist Chris Dadge (Chad VanGaalen, Alvvays) carve out detailed analog productions in the proud tradition of DIY recorders such as early Guided By Voices, R. Stevie Moore, and the McCartney album, while the songs themselves recall the likes of Teenage Fanclub, Tom Petty, and The La's. Their last full-length album 'Remember The Moon' endeared itself to listeners with its compact, tightly-wound strings of melody and bustling rhythms, and the Toronto Star said “Lab Coast has grown so good at making a certain species of scuffed-up, small-scale psych-pop that the rest of Canada really no longer has any excuse not to pay attention.”	["music"]	[]	\N	\N	Chris Dadge	587-893-7925	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1593198412/artist/1666/cover_photo.jpg	2020-06-26 19:05:30.932+00	2020-06-26 19:18:03.962+00	\N	\N	[{"index":0,"publicId":"artist/1666/hi-res/0.jpg","version":1593198836},{"index":1,"publicId":"artist/1666/hi-res/1.jpg","version":1593199018},{"index":2,"publicId":"artist/1666/hi-res/2.jpg","version":1593199081}]	[{"mediaType":"embeddedYoutube","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB22FgiuNJo"},{"mediaType":"youtubeChannel","url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcNk4DJ6PxgflrqiT1Perwg/"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/labcoast"},{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/labcoast"},{"mediaType":"twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/labcoast"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"http://www.labcoast.com"},{"mediaType":"soundCloud","url":"https://soundcloud.com/labcoast"},{"mediaType":"bandcampArtist","url":"https://labcoast.bandcamp.com"},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://labcoast.bandcamp.com/track/helen-bach-2","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"1094789997"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://labcoast.bandcamp.com/track/bored-again-2","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"4049283547"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://labcoast.bandcamp.com/track/pointe-of-it-all","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"1721286112"}}]	Lab Coast is the long-running, critically-acclaimed songwriting outlet of David Laing & Chris Dadge (Chad VanGaalen, Alvvays), specializing in compact, hook-laden tunes, and clever band arrangements.	indie-rock	["alternative","rock"]	originals	\N	KB22FgiuNJo	\N	\N	\N

1653	Farhad is an Edmonton-based composer and santur player. He has been described by the Calgary Herald as “ … A fine instrumentalist who is musical in every way, it was a pleasure to hear his work, combining fine improvisational qualities with his command of the instrumentally attractive, melodically alluring sounds of his santur.” \r\n\r\nIn 2017, Farhad received the Edmonton Arts Council’s Cultural Diversity in the Arts project grant to record his debut album titled ‘Sleeping in Sorrow’. Though rooted in Iranian classical music, different textures of percussion, mixed with Western cello and violin, merge together with the santur to tell the story of child labour; a story that cannot be told by words alone. The album was released in September 2017 and was shortlisted for the Edmonton Music Prize in 2017, and nominated for the Edmonton Music Awards and the Western Canadian Music Awards in 2018. \r\n\r\nFarhad received both Alberta Foundation for the Arts and Edmonton Arts Council grants in 2018 to record his sophomore album titled “Mosàfer” – A santur and percussion duo that translates some of the deepest existential Persian poetries into instrumental music. This album is set to release in summer 2020. In this work, Farhad has explored sounds and textures through experimenting with different techniques and effects on his instrument, the santur, and on percussion played by Daniel Stadnicki. Farhad and Daniel have performed multiple times together as a duo and in Farhad’s quintet.

1707	Meet Katlin Mathison - otherwise known as Okay Mann, whose childhood fascination with campfire singalongs sent him across the pond for a mentorship with Paul McCartney, a gold single in Norway, and eventually led him back to the harsh weather and friendly faces of Manitoba, Canada. \r\n\r\nArmed with a new moniker and a suitcase of songs born of a Winnipeg winter, Okay Mann returned to the cobblestone streets of Liverpool, UK to record his debut release, Little Mersey. By combining modern recording technology with traditional analog tape methods, he crafted a unique timepiece: a snapshot caught on magnetic tape of a city left behind. Okay Mann followed up his debut with two singles: straddling the line between invention and convention, It Won't Be Long's uplifting pop sensibility helps the dark lyrics hide in plain sight. Ring Road, with its infectious chorus and energetic production, works through the frustration of trying to look to the future with two feet planted firmly in the past.\r\n\r\nNow based in Calgary, Okay Mann is currently releasing a string of upbeat singles ahead of a full-length album later this year. His is the tale of a curious nomad: living and dying, one song at a time.

1811	From Honolulu, Hawaii, Joanna G has stepped into the Southern California music scene and quickly became a highly requested musician.

This song was written to remind us all to live every day like we're gonna die, but try not to actually kill ourselves.    \r\n\r\n         “I write music to download the words and marry them with melody, because that is my craft.

673	\r\n\r\nBow Valley folk-pop songwriter Amelie Patterson is a pop music workhorse with hooks to spare.\r\n\r\nHer new single, the dazzling alt-pop  ‘Let Your Trouble Go’ is about empathy, and “wishing you could hold a loved one's burden for them,” Amelie Patterson describes, making space for a loved one so they can “take the afternoon off.” Amelie penned the song in New Orleans in January of 2020 to the beat of French Quarter buskers. By the time she took the idea to producer Ryan Worsely (Dear Rouge, MONOWHALES, Mother Mother) in June, the world was a very different place. Worsely and Patterson took the folk fixations of the song and surrounded it with sprightly strings and a helplessly head-bopping beat. Moments of levity interrupt the cerebral track with vocal modulation and soaring chorus worthy of Imogen Heap.\r\n\r\n‘Let Your Trouble Go’ is the latest drop from her newest concept-driven studio project, The Playlist. Rather than recording and releasing all at once, The Playlist is a stream of rolling singles, traversing the emotional, lyrical, and genre spectrum. Whatever captures Amelie’s creative imagination is harnessed and brought to the the world in a living and breathing series of songs. The first two tracks from the project have already received critical acclaim including a nomination for Alternative Recording Of The Year from the YYC Music Awards in 2020 for ‘The Patient Kind.’ Her debut album Roll Honey Roll received Alternative Recording of The Year in 2017.\r\n\r\nAmelie has performed alongside Sarah Harmer, Matt Anderson, and Serena Ryder, and has performed at festivals including the Calgary Folk Festival, BlockHeater 2020, and Stampede City Sessions. Amelie is a songwriting tour de force drawing heavy comparisons to indie-folk contemporaries including Arcade Fire, Kathleen Edwards, Begonia, and Feist. Patterson served as the inaugural poet laureate of Banff, Alberta.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n“Canadian singer-songwriter Amelie Patterson is one of music’s most exciting artists.”\r\n\r\n             - Pop Culturalist, 2019 ​\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n“This combination of high energy and edgy cool will be familiar to fans of Gin Wigmore, while Patterson stays close to her core indulgences of roots and Americana. The result is an energetic party song with a driving pulse, that extends the complex sensibility of Patterson’s aesthetic into the uncharted waters of electro pop and indie electronic. The Patient Kind is a vibrant exploration of the no-stress attitude that could belong to anyone with an instinct for self-satisfaction."   \r\n\r\n             - ChillFiltr, 2019\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n“Every cliché you can think of when listening to music that simply feeds your soul came to mind; “chills up my spine,” “gives me goose bumps,” “foot-tapping, head bopping.” Patterson’s music ticks all the boxes of what constitutes as a good tune and her innovation in song writing is possibly unmatched.”\r\n\r\n             - Alana MacLeod, RM Outlook 2019 ​\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n“#cfmf16 up and comer Amelie Patterson was a highlight of my festival this year, watch out for this girl!”\r\n\r\n             - John Abraham, Delirium SPB\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n"Patterson’s vocals are bluesy and the beat is sexy, what more do you need?"\r\n\r\n             - Hype Machine, 2019	["music"]	[]	Young professionals that are hard working and appreciate nature.

1948	I play a lot of the classics when I play live, with a repertoire of 70+ songs (Bee Gees, Beatles, Frank Sinatra, ABBA, Nat King Cole, Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, etc). But also I know top 40 and modern music (John Mayer, Ed Sheehan, Shawn Mendes, Justin Bieber, Taylor Swift, etc) I do a lot of busking (3 days a week) over at Larchmont Village in Hancock Park so I'm well acquainted with that aspect of live performing/entertaining. I also have my own setup battery powered amp and microphone! My music sets have ranged from 3-5 hours without a break (but obviously if there is room for a break that's great).

1087	The origin of alternative/indie artist Danielle Dayton’s soulful voice and songwriting savvy is atypical. The tap dancer turned singer-songwriter has a unique relationship with music, rhythm and story. Her experiences as a dancer have shaped the style and groove of the music she creates, securing accolades from Alan Cross, DOMINIONATED and Great Dark Wonder. \r\n\r\nHer 2017 EP “Run” received an Edmonton Music Award nomination and her following singles “Spider Blues” and “Lady Luck” set in motion two Canadian tours from Vancouver Island to Toronto. Most recently, “Lady Luck” landed a placement and feature in the new Documentary “Prairie Sound: Portrait of a Music Producer.”\r\n\r\nThis Alberta-born songwriter weaves vivid stories into her songs, accented by her deeply dark vocal timbre and soaring melodies. Her sound is akin to Elle King and Brandi Carlille, who happen to be her two music heroes. \r\n\r\nDanielle’s latest single “I Can’t Lose You,” is a dark pop ballad with epic swelling strings, moody piano chords, driving acoustic guitar, and haunting vocal soundscapes. The song portrays a relationship in need of resuscitation. Love has vanished into a deep, dark forest and requires a signal fire in hopes to be found again.

1659	People keep calling me a folk singer, which isn’t wrong, exactly. Certainly, there are superficial similarities (acoustic guitar, shaggy hair, plaid shirts). I’ve spent years working in a garage band, a jazz ensemble, a métis dance band, an afropop group and a mexican son jarocho collective, and I’m still exploring and combining those influences. These projects have made me an ambitious technical musician and an idiosyncratic lyricist. I strive for energetic music, strong hooks, and making the audience move. \r\n\r\nI took the name Tamarack because it helps me break out a little farther from the expectations of singer-songwriter folk; to play a little louder, to compose in different, sometimes challenging ways, to write weirder, wilder songs.

1998	“Riveting” (Opera Canada) is how Kathleen Morrison’s voice and performances have been described. Her career over the past 10 years has been based in Canada and Germany (primarily in Berlin), where she is known for her rich voice and dramatic portrayals. Previously singing the Dramatic Coloratura repertoire (Die Königin Der Nacht, Konstanze, Elettra), Kathleen has moved into the Full Lyric/Spinto repertoire (Violetta, Tosca). Highlights of Kathleen’s time in Germany include her debut with the Club-Theater Berlin in 2012 as Konstanze in Die Entführung aus dem Serail, performing for 2 seasons in the smash hit "Breakin' Mozart" in the historic Wintergarten Varieté Berlin, and numerous performances with the Kammeroper Kleinmachnow, where she was a roster singer. In November of 2014, Kathleen had the privilege of performing the role of Marzelline in Beethoven’s freedom opera, Fidelio, which was special because it was part of the official celebrations of the 25th Anniversary of the Fall of the Berlin Wall.

Fresh off her successful and critically acclaimed album, Life Without Regret; her latest 4 song EP, Cabriolet, demonstrates Charlsey's evolution as a personally relevant lyricist, with a distinct, purely unique voice that constantly defies genre. Charlsey is passionate about feminism- particularly its role in love and relationships, so her songs are often reflections of that.

400	Angela Wrigley was destined to be a singer. Literally, before she was born her father said, “I hope she’s a girl and I hope she can sing.”\r\n\r\nAngela, Dave Lake and Derek Stoll began the Angela Wrigley Trio in 2016 and started rehearsing regularly and playing around Calgary. Dave and Derek both lent their own creative influences to Angela’s compositions and arrangements, and their dedication to the music created the sound that they currently have today. \r\n\r\nThese influences have accelerated the trio towards their first album, You Don’t Know What Love Is, and created a unique, sultry, soulful style. Drawing from jazz standards, rock hits and pop classics, they have created a body of work that intricately describes the story of love and loss, hope and longing, and what it means to deeply and truly be “in love”. Angela’s own compositions describe these feelings with poignant accuracy and with the dedication of her bandmates she delivers an emotional and heartfelt depiction of what it means to have loved deeply, and lost. \r\n	["music"]	["jazz","rb","singer-songwriter","soul"]		\N	Angela Wrigley	4038364957	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1626128154/artist/400/cover_photo.jpg	2018-02-10 18:42:24.146+00	2021-07-12 22:21:58.633+00	Anytime!

1729	Whether she graces the stage with simply her piano and a song, or with her electrifying band, Sierra Jamerson bares her soul on stage. Sonically, she is described as "Fiona Apple and Erykah Badu all wrapped into one”. Her message is one of peace. Lyrically she is raw and honest, tackling themes of self-love, body image, the environment, spirituality, heartbreak, passion, and equality. Her songs are derived from a wisdom beyond her years, and the desire to uplift and reach the heart of everyone who hears her.  While she can demonstrate her vocal prowess in nearly any genre from reggae to rock, her heart finds its home in the Jazz, RnB, and  introspective pop music she grew up on. \r\n\r\nSierra has performed with many notable international artists, including Mavis Staples, legendary Motown group The Drifters, Madagascar Slim and Josh Groban. One of her proudest achievements occurred in 2005, where she sang in a command performance for Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. She has received numerous awards for her music, including the Rawlco Radio Continuing Award, Astral Media Radio GP Scholarship, and the Big Miller Award for musical excellence.  Her debut EP, "Blood in the Water" was nominated for Best Urban Recording at the Western Canadian Music Awards. It also reached number two on Ride the Tempo's indie charts and has been played on radio stations across North America. She is currently writing and recording her second EP, which is taking shape as her most confessional piece of work yet.

We performed at the Burnersphere inside Beakerhead’s Spectacle, and we also had the honour of performing a modern light bellydance piece on stage for le Cirque de la Nuit's signature show Wondrous!

1766	\r\n\r\nHarpdog Brown has grown a solid reputation as a real-deal purveyor of classic electric blues. Think of the old Chess Records and Sun Records of the late ’40s and early ‘50s. These days he’s been touring with a new show called Harpdog Brown & the Uptown Blues Band - a vintage New Orleans Blues sound that’s piano driven and features some incredible horn playing. Any show might feature slide trombone, trumpet, clarinet and often a sax and clarinet. Still a vintage vibe, just a different vintage! This music will move you! They perform mostly originals yet they often include great songs of the masters from that era. Think Louis Jordan, Satchmo, Sonny Boy Williamson, Wynonie Harris, even Duke Ellington. Audiences are raving about this new show!\r\n\r\nHe’s been called a Blues Evangelist, and that’s a very fitting moniker. "I speak the blues like it's the truth, and it is”, he was recently quoted. "I do feel like I'm a servant of the people. A missionary if you will. Music can heal people if they pay attention to the messages in these songs.” He delivers those messages using the vintage sound whether it be with his lowdown classic blues band the Travelin’ Blues Show or with his Uptown Blues Band. Harpdog says "Blues has a healing power. It's a beautiful celebration of our perfectly flawed lives. We help people forget about their issues of the moment and then they realize that we all have our issues, and that's OK." \r\n\r\nVancouver-based Harpdog Brown is a gifted vocalist and an imaginative harmonica player born in Edmonton in 1962. An adopted child, he has felt somewhat detached his whole life - "a lifelong battle of not feeling like I belonged. I feel like I was born for the circus, you know, born to travel. The blues tapped me on the shoulder years ago and said 'this is where you belong, son'. So the blues became my circus and there's no better way to travel than with a band!”\r\n\r\nOver the years Harpdog, yes that is his real name as his passport will attest, has issued 7 CD’s to critical acclaim.  Back in 1995 his Home is Where The Harp Is won the coveted Muddy Award for the Best North West Blues Release, from the Cascade Blues Association in Portland.  He is still the only Canadian to do so.  A Juno Nomination for the best Blues Release in Canada followed that same year.  Teamed up with Graham Guest on piano, his CD Naturally was voted #1 Canadian Blues Album of 2011 by The Blind Lemon Survey.  He’s also received three nominations for Blues Artist of the Year by the Western Canadian Music Awards.  These are outstanding accomplishments that clearly solidify his rise in popularity and a new beginning in his career.\r\n\r\nThe album that delivered his first Maple Blues Award, titled What It Is, maintained status in the blues and roots charts throughout the year and in fact was ranked #20 worldwide Roots Music Report: Top 100 Blues Albums of 2014.  Two songs on that album, Whiskey Bottle and In My Younger Days remained in the TOP 100 Songs for that same year.  It is a great collection of live, off the floor originals and a few well placed covers that resonate well with blues fans of every vintage.  Harpdog's original How Come is a fan favourite and earned regular rotation on BB King's Bluesville on SiriusXM.\r\n\r\nHarpdog has won four Maple Blues Awards as Harmonica Player of the Year (2014/2015/2016/2019) and has claimed the Fraser Valley Music Award. In 2016 and again in 2019, he was nominated for 3 Maple Blues Awards (Harmonica Player, Male Vocalist and Album of the Year) for his albums Travelin’ With The Blues and For Love & Money. Travelin' With The Blues released in 2016 and follows his Top 20 charting 2014 release What It Is (Roots Music Report International Blues Albums). For Love & Money was released in 2019 and debuted at #6 on the Living Blues Radio Charts where it stayed for a few months.

351	Say hello to Rozette, and sink your teeth, into BITE—the big, powerful, wild, fun, sexy, quirky and SO empowering it’s-basically-selfish spring anthem you didn’t know you needed.  \r\n\r\nRozette has been sharing her big, powerful and technically masterful voice across North America for the past decade. With the power of Gaga, the attitude of Pink and the old-soul maturity of Adele, Rozette’s upcoming EP combines and unleashes her #sorrynotsorry, empowering, feminist spirit like none of her previous work. \r\n\r\nBITE is about indulging in all those things you want, that for some ridiculous reason we’re still led to believe aren’t acceptable, or worse, “lady-like" to want. Things like: confidence, sex, spontaneity, being loud, being sassy, and behaving with an utter shamelessness throughout it all. \r\n\r\nFollowing BITE, “Fallback”, Rozette’s LGBTQ tribute, will be released July 8, just in time to soak in the empowering vibes in high summer.  #Singer/Songwriter	["music"]	["folk","pop","singer-songwriter","soul"]	Folks in their 20's, 30's 40's and 50's.

1911	"When it comes to setting the bar high, Canadian r&b-pop artist Josh Sahunta never lets his feet touch the ground. Drawing upon his influences of John Mayer, Ed Sheeran and The Weeknd, Josh's songwriting is packed with deeply rich narratives and cool, contemporary soundscapes. Josh has opened for the likes of Scott Helman and Joey Landreth, and he continues to perform across Canada, the US and Europe. Josh's two latest releases have had major support from Apple Music and Spotify and have been featured on several Spotify editorial playlists such as “New Music Friday Canada", as well as several major Apple Music playlists such as “New Music Daily”. Josh's single “Wanting”  has received recent support from Pete Tong and MistaJam on BBC Radio 1 in the UK and from Tiesto on his weekly podcast. Josh was also recently selected as the winner of the Corus Radio $20k Summer Song competition which had over 3000 entrants from all over Canada. Most recently, Josh’s song “Take All I Am” was used on season 2 of the Netflix Original show The Order, and his song “Summertime” was used on the first season of Netflix Original Tiny Pretty Things.\r\n“Josh Sahunta is one of those creative prodigies who excels at absolutely everything he touches.” – BK On The Scene	["music"]	[]	\N	\N	Josh Sahunta	780-243-6754	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1629477625/artist/1911/cover_photo.jpg	2021-08-20 16:40:03.266+00	2021-08-20 16:41:48.127+00	\N	\N	[{"index":0,"publicId":"artist/1911/hi-res/0.jpg","version":1629477643},{"index":1,"publicId":"artist/1911/hi-res/1.jpg","version":1629477686},{"index":2,"publicId":"artist/1911/hi-res/2.jpg","version":1629477705}]	[{"mediaType":"embeddedYoutube","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fs-w7S2FS0"},{"mediaType":"youtubeChannel","url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6Ltk-jQS7JRV5bO3c5EqIw"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"http://instagram.com/joshsahunta"},{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/joshsahuntaa"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"https://www.joshsahunta.com"},{"mediaType":"spotify","url":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/37aXAbBndtjTPR4aUKumLV"},{"mediaType":"appleMusic","url":"https://music.apple.com/ca/artist/josh-sahunta/593944103"},{"mediaType":"soundCloud","url":"https://soundcloud.com/joshsahunta"},{"mediaType":"bandcampArtist","url":"https://joshsahunta.bandcamp.com/"},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://joshsahunta.bandcamp.com/track/falling-for-you","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"440042237"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://joshsahunta.bandcamp.com/track/well-be-alright","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"2503006950"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://joshsahunta.bandcamp.com/track/leave-summer-behind","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"1227982973"}}]	Blending the sounds of John Mayer and Ed Sheeran, Josh Sahunta is a multi-award nominated artist who has not only toured internationally, but also has had his music played on Top 40 radio and TV.	pop	["rb","singer-songwriter"]	originals	\N	0fs-w7S2FS0	\N	\N	\N

1786	 “Maddie’s songs are political and deeply empathetic – they could well be heard drifting out of a Greenwich Village Folk Club in the 1960’s” – Edmonton Folk Fest\r\n\r\nWith the goal of “uniting the hippies and the cowboys” as Willie Nelson once did decades ago, Storvold is quickly finding her sure-footing in the whiskey-soaked badlands at the intersection of Outlaw Country and Alt-Folk. In 2019, she won CTV’s The Launch, receiving the opportunity to record and release a ballad, “Don’t Say You Love Me”, written and produced by Bryan Adams. The single shot to #1 on the country charts in less than 3 hours, and peaked at #3 on the overall charts, surpassing Lady Gaga and Pink. This successful single only supplemented her already-acclaimed catalogue of mature songs and dedicated fanbase in Western Canada. She has showcased her songcraft at the Edmonton Folk Fest, Canmore Folk Fest, Tiny Lights, Bear Creek Folk Fest, Tiny Lights, North Country Fair, and Wild Mountain.\r\n\r\nStorvold offers a catalogue of songs saturated with candour and depth, a lighthearted vulnerability, and a splash of piss and vinegar at the forefront of a new generation of storytellers.

1917	Jake Walters is an exciting upcoming Arizona musician whose work spills across a variety of genres. Having started to play music, and perform in musical theatre, at just 8 years old, Walters quickly developed a love for the art of performance. By age 14 he had picked up guitar and bass. Shortly after, he formed alt-rock band Idle Lights, who would go on to play around the state. By 2016, he was also releasing solo material to supplement his work with the band. Just a few years later he’d graduate with a Bachelor of Music degree and the ambition to take on the world. \r\n\r\nWith a sound that pulls from a variety of influences ranging from Michael Jackson and Prince to Lady Gaga and Bjork by way of Queen, and of course musical theater, Jake Walters has impressed regional audiences for years. His vocal talents won 1st place in the 2019 Arizona District NATS Competition, and his solo music can be found on the House of Indie Pop Spotify playlist. Somehow during all of this, he found a way to release 3 solo albums, and harness his theatrical stage presence to become a local favorite. By the time Idle Lights released their debut album in March of 2020, the band was ready to make a big splash, unfortunately this was stymied by the COVID-19 outbreak. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, Jake Walters has remained busy. He’s currently working hard not just on a fourth solo album, but a few other secret projects as well. His overarching vision remains to fuse his disparate passions together into a larger, more grandiose offering. With sky high ambitions, and the talent to match, Walters humbly commands your attention. \r\n	["music"]	[]		\N	Jacob Walters	520-237-4243	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1629769001/artist/1917/cover_photo.jpg	2021-08-24 01:34:31.088+00	2021-08-24 01:37:10.828+00	\N	[]	[{"index":0,"publicId":"artist/1917/hi-res/0.jpg","version":1629769015},{"index":1,"publicId":"artist/1917/hi-res/1.jpg","version":1629769029}]	[{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/khakijake"},{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/jakewaltersmusic"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"https://www.jakewaltersmusic.com"},{"mediaType":"spotify","url":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/1FpAz4eBd5mYPYb9gGQRBS?si=xER39SAPTEi-cDMsQOJDEg&dl_branch=1"},{"mediaType":"bandcampArtist","url":"https://jakewalters.bandcamp.com"},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://jakewalters.bandcamp.com/track/fire","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"242926505"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://jakewalters.bandcamp.com/track/the-golden-hour","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"3766450158"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://jakewalters.bandcamp.com/track/evelyn","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"4109365967"}}]	Pop music infused with the heat and passion of the Sonoran Desert from which I was born. 	singer-songwriter	["pop"]	originals	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

2131	Emily Vay is an emotive performer who combines poetic, singer/songwriter pop with contemporary, electronic flourishes. Based in Calgary, takes influence from artists such as Ashe, Aurora and Joy Crooks, with a sound reminiscent of Florence and the Machine and Lana Del Rey.\r\n\r\nVay is currently writing and recording her debut EP, which will be released this fall (2020). The project shows a new side of Vay as she explores a blending of genres. \r\n\r\n“It's more pop, but still has a dark undertone and a wide range of vocals, which I think makes it separates it from my past projects.” she explains. Produced by Heath West and co-produced by Vay, the EP speaks loudly about Vay’s recent struggles with her mental health, relationships, and moving forward.\r\n\r\nVay’s single, “Time Travellers” (2018), was featured on Spotify's Folk and Friends playlist and broke into 106.7 The Drive’s (Red Deer) regular airplay rotation. Her first solo single, “Dollhouse” (2017) was written about her brother's battle with alcoholism.\r\n\r\n“Seeing someone you love battle addiction is really, really hard. I watched my brother become a puppet to his addiction without his knowledge and that was the catalyst of the song. The lyrics ‘a puppet you’re becoming, and you don't even know,’ have been very impactful to me.” says Vay.\r\n\r\nVay emerged as a co-writer and featured vocalist on the song, “Pictures” (2016), produced by Damian La Grange, a multi-instrumentalist and producer from Red Deer. The track was added to Spotify's New Music Friday playlist and featured by local radio, which resulted in opportunities for Vay to open for platinum artist Coleman Hell and Hey Ocean.\r\n\r\nVay started her music career studying opera and musical theatre. As a promising young opera singer, she was accepted into an opera performance program at the University of British Columbia (2017). However, at the same time, Vay was introduced to production and songwriting while working with La Grange, who is best known for his single, “Beautiful Distractions” (2017). At this point, she made the decision to turn down her university scholarships and dedicate herself to songwriting and performing.\r\n	["music"]	[]	\N	\N	Emily Vaillant	4035963004	\N	t	\N	2022-06-07 21:27:18.759+00	2022-06-07 21:27:18.768+00	\N	\N	\N	[{"mediaType":"embeddedYoutube","url":"https://youtu.be/yaqaWNnmeW0"},{"mediaType":"youtubeChannel","url":"https://youtube.com/channel/UCG_3zlg8wBbO0XI__Mr1X4g"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"https://instagram.com/emily_vay?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y="},{"mediaType":"website","url":"https://www.emilyvay.com/"},{"mediaType":"spotify","url":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/1yOlcSmUb7vvCZ1x0fEXfH?si=eZD2tbItTziZvzknuBnCgw"}]	Emily Vay is an emotive performer based in Calgary Alberta  who combines poetic, singer/songwriter pop with contemporary, electronic flourishes.	singer-songwriter	["folk","pop"]	originals	\N	yaqaWNnmeW0	\N		["white","female"]

2313	Inspired by everyday life in rural Prince Edward Island, Nolan creates music that reflects the authentic country lifestyle in which he lives. Growing up on the family potato farm with the sounds of Merle Haggard, Keith Whitley, and George Strait on the radio, Nolan’s music nods to his early influences and pairs it with a modern country style reminiscent of Josh Turner, Trace Adkins, and Luke Combs.\r\n\r\nNolan’s early career has already drawn lots of attention to his name after launching his debut single Unbelievable. "Unbelievable" has listeners all over the globe, has radio plays all over Canada, was the fifth most-downloaded country single on September 21/21, and he was the most active independent artist during that week.\r\n \r\nOn January 28th, 2022, Nolan released his second single "Back To Sleep".

987	Tyson Ray Borsboom is a folk singer songwriter from Lethbridge, AB, Canada. He began singing and experimenting with the acoustic guitar at the age of 16 and soon after started a alternative rock group "Mollys Amigo" (wordplay of Kings of Leon tunes). When the band fell apart shortly after he began focusing on his indie folk style. He now draws most of his inspiration from artists like Ziggy Alberts , Ben Howard, Donovan Woods , and Shakey Graves. Tyson Ray emerged on the local scene with his "Sinner" EP in February 2018. Songs like "Four Years" demonstrate his deep baritone vocals, however "Sinner" and "Caroline" reveal a more imitate, finger picking side to his songwriting. \r\n\r\nHeading into a more alternative sound while retaining his folk roots he began to embody old loves such as The National, The Strokes, Foals and Gang of Youths. Tyson Rays new projects have seen him working with Chad Gilmour (The Long War) and Shane Twerdun at "One Song Series" for the live session recording of the new single "Home" recorded in Vancouver, Canada. Shortly after finishing up in Vancouver, Tyson headed right back into the studio with Cottonwood records for his new single off his fourth coming album "Her" to be released in January 2019. Tyson hopes to have his first full length album in Fall of 2019.

2192	With a focus on songwriting over the last two years, Justin Hogg is thrilled to be at the brink of releasing his 6th studio single to digital platforms and Canadian Country radio. Recorded with multi-platinum award-winning producer Jeff Dalziel, the new single “Thats How I Know” has Justin wearing his heart on his sleeve as the sole writer on this unique and sincere take on what it means to know you’re in love. Justin has received nation-wide radio airplay, has charted in the Top 100 on the Trax Report, and also has two official nominations for “Songwriter of the Year” in 2017 and 2019 for his song’s “Smoke Signals” and “Just Drive”, respectively.\r\nHis style is a blend of country, rock, and pop music with his own twist of originality, and his hard work and dedication to his craft have afforded him opportunities to open for the likes of country superstars Jess Moskaluke, Brett Kissel and High Valley, among many others. Justin continues to write music with the goal of connecting with his listeners and providing them with his most authentic self through his music.

1121	New 2021 Covid-Friendly professional edition! The best horn players in town, the best percussionists, unique arrangements and great accessibility. You have not seen anything like this, but check out other "New Age Brass Bands" for a sense of what it is. Our new 2021 videos on YouTube are "You & Me" and "Doghouse".\r\n\r\nDesigned for the street.  We know outdoor music is king in the waning time of the pandemic, as the vaccines free us from a year of silence. So, we are quite sure you want a band designed for the outdoors.  Building on the ancient New Orleans traditions, but re-imagined for Calgary, there is nothing like this in the world.  \r\n\r\nDelirium was formed in 2012. Inspired by the evolving “riot jazz” brass bands (e.g. The Soul Rebels, The Dirty Dozen Brass Band, The Youngblood Brass Band ) the Calgary based musicians wanted to leave most of the jazz influence behind and push the genre further into ska, punk and party rock, focusing on high energy music like No Doubt and The Clash and strong female vocals. Until 2017 the band was headlined by Margo Laing, with increasing emotional appeal through her expressive songwriting, voice, and stage presence, the album "House of the Rising Sun" highlights this era.  In 2018 the band reformed for the Banff wedding season with more drums, more horns, and two vocalists: Kevin Waites, and Margo’s kid Jace. New works include "Stroke Therapy", a healing jam song, and covers of Taylor Swift, the Cat Empire, and Queen.  \r\n\r\nThe 2021 waning pandemic version has more percussion, more vocalists, and a level of precision that will impress.  \r\n\r\nWith the brass and percussion instrumentation, and no guitars or keyboards, these covers are completely different yet intimately familiar, with a street-style dance vibe.  Songs on Spotify or Apple Music.  The new 2021 videos on Youtube show the current vocal and percussion focus, recorded at Studio D and shot at ContainR.

They love to engage with their audience and build lasting bonds through music. “We understand the role that songs have in people’s lives. If someone is falling in love for the first time, there’s a melody that sends shivers up their spine. If somebody wants to soak up every minute of summer, you bet there’s a song for that! If somebody is feeling sad or alone, music is also there,” says Carolina. They’ve performed at the The Bitter End in New York City, the legendary Ironwood Stage in Calgary, Canada, and Cowboys Dance Hall. The sisters have performed live at various festivals and Libraries across Calgary, including the new Central Library. “Getting up onstage is always so special to us. It’s an honour to be able to share our music with people and hear how it has impacted their lives. We truly appreciate them opening up to us like that,” says Maria. Whether it’s capturing a heartfelt moment or energizing the crowd with an upbeat song, they are able to convey their message through the powerful language of music.

1312	My music has many faces....rock...blues...country...folk...celtic...latin...and speaks with many tongues about who I am, what I believe in, and what makes me laugh.\r\n\r\nI've been influenced by artists like Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Bruce Cockburn, Eric Clapton, Tom Petty, Bonnie Raitt, and MANY of the independent artists that I have heard over the years. They inspire me and keep the songwriting candle burning.\r\n\r\nWhat sets me apart from other singer/songwriters/performers I think is my ability to engage the audience. To me, it's all about the audience. If they're not having a good time, what's the point? Otherwise, I might as well just be home playing in my studio. They provide me with energy and a reason to perform. \r\n\r\nWhen I'm playing a gig, my purpose is to touch the audience in some way, to inspire them, to make them laugh, and to make them feel like they've had a great time! One of the ways I do that is to bring along a variety of percussion instruments and invite the audience to be my "back up" band. \r\n\r\nIt never ceases to amaze me how much everyone, young and old alike, enjoy doing that and becoming a real part of the music experience. \r\n\r\n"Herky Cutler is a fantastic one-man musician with excellent taste and musical variety.

2031	The Artist in Question,\r\n\r\nAshton Souliere Raving Lunatic,\r\n\r\nIs one that doesn’t fit most normal boxes, he ad-libs a lot of lyrics, loves singing in weird notes and registers. But still does a good job. \r\n\r\nNo way you could pull him away from playing his favourite tunes day and night. On repeat day after day after day and somehow he’s not tired of it…insanity I tell you. \r\n\r\nHe even tries dancing in the streets like some broadway maniac, trying to spread the joy of how he’s feeling and looking. Good good good. \r\n\r\nHe kept his family up a lot of nights singing poorly as a child, and after almost 20 years he’s finally got a hand on playing and singing guitar at the same time. \r\n\r\nOverall he just wants to show off the hard work he’s been putting into himself as an artist. Hopefully it shows out on the stage someday.

Her debut EP, coyly titled ''An EP,' was released June 26th, 2020. She released her debut single ''Unsteady'' in March with follow-up singles ''193'' and ''Nice Guy'' which were lauded as being fresh, straightforward, and sincere. Influenced by female pop/ R&B heroes like Julia Michaels, Niki, and UMI, HAIDEE writes and records her music in a cozy basement studio in an effort to preserve the emotional honesty of her music. ''There is something about not tracking in a traditional studio that keeps me authentic and vulnerable rather than feeling like I am performing, where I am more critical of myself,'' she explains.

1142	Growing up, Lisa didn’t have access to a lot of music education, especially for flute. Most of her early learning was self-taught. At the beginning of her university degree in Calgary, she auditioned for an ensemble and was devastated when she wasn’t accepted. However, she knew she had to keep playing. With a quick online search, she found a teacher who promptly answered her email and she started her first lessons. Those lessons completely changed her life.\r\n\r\nLisa is privileged to share music at weddings, concerts, charity events, and more. One of her most exciting musical adventures was a trip to Portugal in 2012. Along with three other musicians, Lisa visited schools in Porto. She helped deliver a presentation on famous people who practiced both science and music. The program included both scientific nuggets interspersed with musical excerpts. She also had the opportunity to perform in two public concerts (in one of which she internationally debuted a piece she composed) and as a guest of a Gregorian chant choir at a third. Since returning, Lisa has guest lectured on science and music at the University of Calgary.\r\n\r\nIn performance, Lisa loves sharing the unexpected. In her travels, she has come across many wonderful pieces including some from obscure local composers. She is font of curated and sharing these with listeners in a concert hall or more informal setting. The joy of discovery goes even further when preparing for a special event. She enjoys the challenge of coming up with the perfect musical program\r\n\r\nLisa is a versatile musician delighted to perform both solo and as a member of a number of local ensembles including the Mount Royal Chamber Flutes (piccolo, flute, alto flute, and bass flute) and The Shillelaghs (piccolo).

She loves all things country and that shines through in her music. \r\nLyndsay’s voice has been compared to some notable artists such as Patsy Cline and Miranda Lambert and her hard hitting, truthful lyrics resemble an early Loretta Lynn. \r\nHer songs are in fact true life stories which connect with a wide audience.

2278	Sarah Houston is an instrumental composer from Calgary, Alberta.  She is a classically trained pianist and has been writing music for as long as she can remember.  In 2019, Sarah realized that in order to fully express herself as a human being, she needed to pursue her lifelong dream of composing and recording her solo music. In 2020, Sarah released her sophomore album, In Time which went on to win Classical Recording of the Year at the 2021 YYC Music awards. Immediately following the release of In Time, Sarah got to work on her latest solo piano project, Windshift, which she released with Canadian neoclassical label, Little Symphony Records in July, 2022. Windshift came out of her desire to learn more about recording in her studio at home over the course of the pandemic. Sarah's music is both soft and moody with a distinctly cinematic feel. She loves to play with rhythm and harmony, creating beautiful textures and voices, and always writing slightly outside the box.

245	Southern-Rock influenced country may seem a bit contradictory in the Great White North, but that's exactly where Devin Cooper hangs his hat. \r\n \r\nAs the son of a motorcycle shop owner and custom car builder, Devin had ample opportunities to be creative, working alongside his old man as he grew up.  At the age of seven, he began playing guitar and eventually traded in his tool kit for a music career.  Thoughtful songwriting, paired with gritty rock ‘n roll vocals, create Devin Cooper’s signature sound. If you like down-home country banjo and anthemic 1980s drum tones, you’ll find them together in Cooper's songs: he does country music his way and doesn't apologize for it.\r\n\r\nIn early 2021, Cooper released the first two singles off his debut EP, which he is currently recording. “Good Things,” the lead single, was released in March 2021 and was the #1 Most Played Song the week of its release on CBC Sirius XM Country. Just days before making his debut on the Nashville North Stage at the Calgary Stampede in July 2021, Cooper released his second single, "Country Cliche," to all streaming platforms.\r\n\r\nStarting 2020,  Cooper performed a sold-out headlining show at The King Eddy in Calgary, Alberta.  When the global pandemic hit, he performed safely at a sold-out drive-in show, where he and Mariya Stokes were direct support for CCMA Award Winner, Jade Eagleson. Cooper also released his first single in two years: "Last Time Last."\r\n\r\nSince 2019, Cooper has written over 200 songs and has performed over 300 live shows, and has had songs he has written and recorded by multiple Canadian artists. Most notably, he was a writer on the 2020 Alberta Country Music Album of The Year (The Ride, Ryan Lindsay).\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 2021, Cooper will release his debut EP.

2234	Profile\r\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\r\n\r\nMIRA BLACK REDEFINES THEATRE WITH MESH OF POETRY, A DASH OF JAZZ & INTENSELY AFFECTING VOCALS AND HEART OPENING LYRICS\r\n\r\n"I write so I won’t forget. I can go back and learn or seek answers or just be with my love again in the present moment. What happens next? What happened then? It’s about the choices, whether over that whole tub of Haagen Daz or with the entire bottle of Glenfiddich, crying over the surrounding boxes and empty spaces or dancing about the freedoms, the unknown and the lessons learned. My music is about my heart which returns to certain moments and re-negotiates the memory more deeply or at least differently than the first time I experienced it. It’s my purging of the end or lamenting about a beginning. Every time I visit that moment I can see and learn something new. The pain and the pleasure both bring me the same passion. ~Mira Black"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Black's Western Canadian Music Award nominee album, “MIRA,” veers to the left of any neatly defined musical genre. She is indeed that rare artist who defies convention. Her new project aims to redefine cultural understandings and philosophies around abused and survivor pointing towards the details in a way that can unify rather than divide or even repel. Forgiveness and love are her mantra. Mira perpetuates dark and difficult conversations while shining the light for those vulnerable topics to bloom through the muck of confusion towards triumphant understanding.\r\n\r\n2013 Self titles record MIRA Produced by iconic Chicago House Music legend Vince Lawrence, her 2012 self titled release has a sound  founded in ambient electronica, but stripped down into sparse stop-and-start beats that trickle, ooze & percolate, ultimately allowing her potent vocals & intimate lyrics to rise to the surface.\r\n\r\n“Getting to the core of Mira’s philosophies became our mission,” says Lawrence, “We start with a rough electronic sketch painted across her organic ideas, but as I listen her sing & understand the poetry in her compositions—how emotional every word is—I like to stay away from too many beats. We ultimately aim to shape something that is subtle & immersive, where you feel every word she’s saying. It distills past any fluff & is profoundly touching.”\r\n\r\nWriting for Mira is about purging as a mechanism to perpetuate growth; speaking deep personal Truths as a way to heal. Those experiences provided tools for authentic analysis & lessons around childhood conditioning, heartbreak, personal Divinity & True love. Working together changed both Vince & Mira as artists. Lawrence says, “The very definition of music is ‘organized sound over time.’ This is sound design, with the musical elements building from Mira’s intense vocals, raw musical compositions, lyrics & proudly honest storytelling. We drilled beyond the BS to a basic core message." Mira's art is a labour of Love in the truest sense of the word.\r\n\r\nShe's now embarking upon her next album embracing the depth of her inner troubadour, organic jazz and folk foundations, theatrical presentation and vulnerably raw lyrics back to the live stage where she belongs.

Brodie is a genuine and inventive voice that rises above and beyond. \r\n\r\nChloe received a scholarship to participate in a five week long performance intensive program at Berklee College of Music, the Aspire Program, in the summer of 2022. After participating in the program, she got accepted into Berklee's undergraduate program in Vocal Performance with a major scholarship.\r\n\r\n“Chloe has an incredibly powerful voice and this cool, confident stage presence; and the bonus is she’s a killer guitar player. The most fun I have is watching audience members lose themselves in her live performance and then lose their minds in encore.

1622	\r\nLucid storytelling, and a wide blend of sounds with good country flavour, Ryan Lindsay’s songwriting, and heartfelt performances as an artist cover alot of ground. Lindsay's music is transparent, and distinguishable by his spirited vocal tone, and reflective words. No stranger to the country, Ryan was raised on the Alberta prairies, worked as a stablehand, and guided in the rockies. His songs contain those influences, often making reference to northern landscapes. Still early in his career, Ryan has built a reputation as a live act, a recording artist, and has received a CCMA nomination for Alternative Album of The Year. His recordings sound like you are listening to a live band - raw in one sense, yet refined in another. His penmanship is rooted and personal, and his songs contain a diverse mix of instrumentation - from acoustic-driven bluegrassy ballads, to up-tempo songs with gritty Telecaster and steel guitar.

They rev it up to punk speed and power while maintaining the melodic sense of the original sound and use the accordion, sax, trumpet, clarinet and sometimes violin for Eastern European folk authenticity.

255	Growing up in Southern Alberta and the land of the long white cloud in New Zealand, Hanna is a singer-songwriter with a passion for soulful, folk reverie upon the art of complicated times. She finds inspiration in the people she meets and her surroundings, which has become a personal study in opposites and extremes. The surreal undertones of everyday experiences across 10 000 miles of her Canadian and New Zealand roots strike the literal chords that resonate into the music she draws into existence.\r\n\r\nA vocalist who has been compared to the musical stylings of the later Annie Lennox, Hanna utilizes a number of instruments including piano, guitar and mandolin to support her songwriting and extensive collection of cover songs. With or without accompaniment, Hanna is a versatile musician comfortable with solo, duo, or group performance in everything from the pub environment to formal events as she continues to develop her practice. Music to Hanna is second nature communication of her insights, observations and joy in every day human moments and interactions.\r\n\r\nThe maple leaf and silver fern are her personal symbols of growth and connection to places and the countries that flow through to nurture her imagination.

The video for the single ‘Home’ was nominated for Alberta Film and Television Awards - Best Music Video 2017.\r\n\r\n In true fashion, Middletown will not let listeners down as Emily continues to push boundaries of the folk/roots genre with influences spanning from Texas blues to her years in French Canada. The youngest of five growing up in a mix of English and French culture, it was in living room jam sessions with local and visiting musicians that Emily learned the history and art of lyrical composition and performance. Emily shares stories through songs with an endearing simplicity that belies their emotional depth.\r\n\r\nProduced by Lorrie Matheson and featuring performances by Chris Byrne, Paul Rigby and Chris Dadge, Middletown is the lamenting heart of roots with the raucous soul of rock that’s never too far from the earthy fields of country.\r\n\r\nThe year ahead involves the release of singles, videos, and tour dates for Alberta, British Columbia, Montreal & area, and Halifax.\r\n	["music"]	[]	All Ages	\N	Emily Triggs	(403) 852-5948	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1544995174/artist/894/cover_photo.jpg	2018-12-16 21:17:01.635+00	2022-01-11 17:30:13.941+00	\N	[{"name":"Calgary Folk Music Festival ","date":"2019/07"},{"name":"Vancouver Folk Music Festival ","date":"2019/07"},{"name":"CBC","date":"2019/12"}]	[{"index":0,"publicId":"artist/894/hi-res/0.jpg","version":1544995644},{"index":1,"publicId":"artist/894/hi-res/1.jpg","version":1544995778},{"index":2,"publicId":"artist/894/hi-res/2.jpg","version":1544996116}]	[{"mediaType":"embeddedYoutube","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl6B1rkiaew"},{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/emilytriggsmusic/"},{"mediaType":"twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/EmilyTriggs"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/emilyvtriggs/"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"http://www.emilytriggs.com"},{"mediaType":"youtubeChannel","url":"https://www.youtube.com/emilytriggs"},{"mediaType":"bandcampArtist","url":"https://emilytriggs.bandcamp.com"},{"mediaType":"spotify","url":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/78BsrF8Cr4EM9wAteMn86y?si=lIyuQa4MT_2OvBIJYRQM0Q"},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://emilytriggs.bandcamp.com/album/when-guinevere-went-under","metadata":{"type":"album","id":"498548330"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://emilytriggs.bandcamp.com/album/middletown","metadata":{"type":"album","id":"3630269647"}}]	A bred-in-the-bones roots musician.

1982	Jiajia Li is a flutist who was born and raised in Beijing, and moved to Calgary in 2014. A classically trained musician, Jiajia’s passion for new music takes her to working with composers closely, premiering new works, and programming innovative concerts. Her recitals are not merely about baroque or contemporary music, but an exploration into presenting music in modern times. She incorporates improvisation, electronic elements, movement, staging, and sometimes inviting the audience to participate. \r\n\r\nJiajia’s wide interests in music have taken her on a journey from concert hall appearances with the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra to improvised shows with the experimental concert series, “Bug Incision”, to directing a traditional Chinese ensemble and forming her latest pop band, “Ginger Beef”. Jiajia is being praised as "one of the city's finest and most adventurous flautists”, and was the 2019 recipient of the “Stingray Classical Artist in Residency” at National Music Centre.

2078	There is a light that burns bright in Hollywood California. It is the fire of a man's soul who's voice can quake the earth with thunderous love. His name is Scott Rocco; a proud Italian American who desires to fuel humanity's underdog spirit with raw heartfelt music and movies that inspire, enlighten, and heal the world. His debut album "Ignited" is currently lighting up the airwaves worldwide. Rocco describes it as "a concept record about a man on a journey of self-discovery and his greatest love who lit the whole way there."\r\n\r\nWinner of the inaugural 626 Icon singing competition, Rocco continues to rise from the indie music scene as a well respected singer-songwriter. His powerful compelling voice is known to captivate audiences into emotional bliss. Nicole Mendes of The Other Side Reviews writes, "If Billy Joel were to have a lovechild with Bruce Springsteen and it was raised by Goo Goo Dolls, the chances are Scott Rocco would be it." \r\n\r\nColm Slattery of Fruit Sonic writes, "Wish You Well "shows off the undeniable talent of Scott Rocco in creating a universe that swirls about in a majestic hue."\r\n \r\nAcknowledging Rocco's layered songwriting, Amelia Vandergast from A & R Factory writes, "His ability to materialise the human condition and the essence of our suffering in his soundscapes is practically unparalleled. As far as I’m concerned, there is no better purveyor of raw heartfelt rock currently contributing to the airwaves. The level of emotion contained in 'Sum of You' is potent enough to reanimate even the most jaded of souls." (I’m pretty much speaking from experience there)\r\n​\r\nRocco's summer themed groove "Joyride" was awarded Best Music Video at New Jersey Web Fest. On the film landscape, his accolades include Best TV Pilot/Series for "Adulthood" awarded by Astoria Film Festival, Vegas Movie Awards, Bowery Film Festival, Freehold Film Festival, and TMFF. He was also honorably mentioned by Wiki: The World's Fastest Screenplay Contest for his feature film script, "Kill The Lights."\r\n​\r\n“I sing and create cinema for the ROCKY underdog in us all -- the contender that must confront insecurity, trauma, and fear throughout our lives. I take these deterrents and channel them into raw art. When making movies, I try to be authentically raw and honest as possible. My music aligns that same belief to create raw heartfelt rock; a type of sound and feeling risen out of love to honestly express myself as a way to inspire, enlighten, and heal people. At the end of the day, no matter what outlet of expression, it's all rock 'n roll to me!"\r\n~ Scott Rocco\r\n​\r\n​	["music"]	[]	Teens <18, College Students 18-22, Adults 23+, Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Perth, Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, London, Amsterdam, Lisbon	\N	Scott Rocco	9147153259	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1649188934/artist/2078/cover_photo.jpg	2022-04-05 19:41:37.247+00	2022-12-01 17:43:15.31+00	Available in Los Angeles, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday 6 - 9 pm / 9 -12 pm\r\nBooked for 6/3 @ The Mint\r\nBooked for 7/22 @ Molly Malones	[{"name":"The Mint","date":"2022/11"},{"name":"Harvard And Stone","date":"2022/09"},{"name":"El Cid","date":"2022/09"}]	[{"index":0,"publicId":"artist/2078/hi-res/0.jpg","version":1649188957},{"index":1,"publicId":"artist/2078/hi-res/1.jpg","version":1649188976},{"index":2,"publicId":"artist/2078/hi-res/2.jpg","version":1649188625}]	[{"mediaType":"embeddedYoutube","url":"https://youtu.be/UF4gKte1qo0"},{"mediaType":"youtubeChannel","url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCceb9NT_ChHipymB5DEVNRQ"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/scottroccoofficial/"},{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/scottroccoofficial/"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"http://www.scottroccomusic.com"},{"mediaType":"spotify","url":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/73uBrdtq5OXWKFAu7yQk6v?si=9Ry3wpVATyuzXLvRhk15nQ"},{"mediaType":"appleMusic","url":"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/scott-rocco/352661719"},{"mediaType":"soundCloud","url":"https://soundcloud.com/scottrocco"},{"mediaType":"bandcampArtist","url":"https://scottrocco.bandcamp.com"},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://scottrocco.bandcamp.com/track/ignited","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"3532334348"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://scottrocco.bandcamp.com/track/joyride","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"2616446602"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://scottrocco.bandcamp.com/track/southern-love","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"487734146"}}]	If Billy Joel were to have a lovechild with Bruce Springsteen and it was raised by Goo Goo Dolls, the chances are Scott Rocco would be it.

472	Based in Calgary, Alberta, indie-folk quartet, Bebo Grove, was formed in 2016 by Jason Selby, a multi-instrumentalist and songwriter, and Jeff Ragan, a classical and flamenco lead guitarist. Selby and Ragan have worked together on numerous projects dating back to 2002. In 2016, Bebo Grove released a four-song demo, Vacant Places, and were the recipients of the Zachariah and the Prophets Memorial Award at the first YYC Music Awards. With the addition of Callum Green on lead vocals and Denver Dominas on drums in early 2019, Bebo Grove has returned to the studio to record both new and old tracks. The band looks forward to the 2019-2020 release of their first LP, Huxlee, dedicated to Selby’s daughter.

2185	For Taylor, singing, writing and performing were built into her DNA. From being born to James Taylor songs in the delivery room, by the tender age of six the soon-to-be breakout artist was already exhibiting signs of being a musician. Despite her hearing impairment from childhood, she found her voice among choirs, eventually making her way to a recording studio in her teens. Despite her hearing loss, Taylor has not let it hold her back from going after her dreams and has made a career for herself as a country singer who is the epitome of resilience. Taylor has trained with the legendary vocal coach to the stars, Bob Garrett (Los Angeles) and Lorraine Lawson (Toronto, ‘The Launch’).  \r\n​\r\nBree has had 4 songs chart on the Canadian Indie Country Charts, her latest single "On My Own" hit #1 in May 2022. Her first single “Cry”, hit #2 on the Canadian Indie Charts and “Burning Bridges” soared to #1 in October 2020 (and was #17 of the Top 50 in Indie Songs of 2020).  Her smash hit "Kryptonite" gave her her second #1 hit on the charts with nominations for “Song of the Year” with the Mississauga Music Awards, “Emerging Solo Vocalist” with the MARTY’s and “Best Country Video of the Year” with Dropout Entertainment in 2021. The song also recently hit the TOP 100 in the CBC Toyota Searchlight contest 2022. Bree has also received nominations for “Drive - Video of the Year” and “Best New Artist” in 2019 with the Mississauga Music Awards and was recently nominated for Established Vocalist of the Year with the MARTY Awards 2022. \r\n​\r\nBree holds philanthropic causes close to her heart. Supporting and bringing awareness to mental health, human equality and poverty. Bree recently kicked off her new concert series 'Cheers & Beers' on June 10th, 2022 in support of TenFed and Kids Against Hunger Canada, helping to feed children and families suffering from food insensitivity in Canada and across the globe.\r\n​\r\nTaylor kicked off 2022, with her anthemic single,“On My Own”, a deeply emotional prose, touching on life's hardships and challenges. Her latest summer single, “Sha La La” tosses back a shooter of summer fun and laughter - dancing and laid back vibes. Taylor presents a picture complete with memories, chances to create new ones, chances to sing-a-long, and chances to fall in love with a brand new track from a country powerhouse in the making. With commanding vocals, and ability to resonate, Taylor is an ode to a young Shania, or Trisha Yearwood. Following on the sonic footprints of Underwood and Ballernini, Taylor is bootstompin’ into the hearts of country fans everywhere. Taylor was truly born with a talent that draws you in and holds you captive till every last grit, grime, and perfectly pitched crescendo has been placed on your lap. You’ll find yourself at the end of a track, rapidly trying to start it all over again.\r\n​\r\nWith a career and brand built on authenticity, honesty and resilience, Bree’s creative ambitions have no limitations. No matter what life throws at her, Bree is and always will be a fighter and will remain truly unapologetically Bree!

424	Vina After Dark’s warm siren vocals will raise goosebumps across your skin as you head-nod to chilled out drums, groovy bass, and ethereal, crying guitar lines. And if you’re lyrically focused, you’re in luck: think Emily Haines’s poetic acuity with Nina Simone’s tender sparseness. But this band’s immersive sound is beyond contemporary pop as it is both celestial and brooding, rapturous yet subtly tailored to the stylistic touches of trip-hop, soul, jazz, folk. \r\n\r\nWhether you're looking for a three-piece band or a solo act, you'll find yourself cloaked in elements of lift and air with their complements of natural rhythm and feel. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn early 2018, Vina After Dark began as a singer-songwriter known for her stage presence and novel, unresolving style that pairs minimalist guitar playing with honeyed, melodic vocals, driving songs at a pensive pace into sweet melancholia.\r\n\r\nBy 2019, Vina After Dark acquired a full-bodied sound and instant appeal with Dav’s twinkling guitar lines and bass playing groove that borrows from Victor Wooten and Juan Nelson. Funk, rhythm, and a whole lot of head-nodding fun came onto the scene with Deifante’s complex fills and idiosyncratic timing that are as dynamic as they are purely based on feel. Watching this trio play is watching a group of friends who have baked their crafts with layers of instrumentation, musicality, natural groove, and of course, plenty of feel. \r\n\r\nThough contemporary pop is at the core of Vina After Dark’s music, their vocally driven, creative tonal range and instrumentation are achieved through the careful and playful knitting of hip-hop, trip-hop, soul, R&B, jazz, and even folk. Soul vocals pierce through the funk and groovy atmospheres that have electronic-inspired underlinings (there’s a lot of kicking in there) which give a touch of the broody mood. The overall effect is a feel and a rhythm that is still hip-hop and pop. Electrifying guitars and synths add textural layers that radiate an ethereal edge. These, along with effortlessly celestial vocals achieve a unique airiness that is subtly grounded by elements beyond that of drums and bass. The drums and the bass may be the roots of Vina After Dark’s songs but the band’s dynamic expressions create breathing spaces for other instrumental forces to support the more stirring sections of music. \r\n\r\nTheir latest, fully produced EP, Us Vs, traces influences from Portishead, Lianne La Havas, Kan Wakan, and Chet Faker. The EP features trip-hop inspired rhythms, heavy bass and kick, melding guitar and synth lines, and signature angelic vocals. The five songs are diverse yet cohesive. The EP opens with smoky heartbreak before lifting through star-dusted warmth. From there, a dive into the sleepy subconscious surfaces against contemplative angst before riding the tail end of post-war pain and ennui. Us Vs is an introspection on Us Vs love Vs us Vs loneliness Vs belief Vs war that is pointed, soothing, emotive, and encapsulating.

2204	Jason is a singer/songwriter raised in small town Alberta and currently based in Calgary. He uses his own unique version of roots and Americana to explore themes of family, connection, nostalgia, mortality, and sometimes just plain boot-stomping fun. \r\n\r\nJason has been playing and writing music for thirty years, both as a solo act and as a part of groups doing original and cover music. He has played coffee shops, bars, and festivals from Edmonton to Calgary and points in between. After a recent hiatus he is excited to get back on stage in 2022. \r\n\r\nJason’s humble, laid back performances make the audience feel like they’re sitting around a campfire with an old friend. With his powerful yet folksy voice and his acoustic guitar, he creates an emotional connection that gets toes tapping, hands clapping, and (every now and then) tears running.

1355	Headed up by childhood friends Jenna and Charity, Meadow Drive hails from Calgary, Alberta. Due to their vast range of musical influences, the band’s distinct sound is a direct result of the unique playing style of each member, rather than their alignment with any particular genre. The band’s jazz roots are apparent in the harmonic structure of the songs and melodic importance of the bass, while their love of funk and disco often shines through with crisp, clean guitar riffs and syncopated drum grooves. Smooth, yet powerful vocals bring even their rock influenced repertoire under the umbrella of the sound they call their own.

2135	OGR-Scintilla makes funny and energetic songs, themed around the stereotypes of being a Canadian. Going to Tim Hortons, playing hockey, and riding your pet moose home to your igloo are all topics he humorously sings about in his music. Thanks to 'OGR's mixture of comedy and positive energy, he has accumulated over 350,000 Tiktok followers, 13,000 youtube subscribers, 17,000 Instagram followers, and millions of streams on digital platforms around the world. Because of this following, OGR has had great success generating a solid turn out of fans and supporters at his shows. Whether headlining a show of his own, or performing at pre-arranged festivals and events, OGR can create a positive, family friendly atmosphere, and help generate attendance.\r\n\r\nWhile 'OGR' rose to success on Tiktok in early 2020 during the covid-19 Pandemic (accounting for the substantial lack of performances between 2020-2021), he has been a musician and performer for over a decade. He also regularly performs to 1000's of viewers via online Tiktok livestreams. He finds himself very at home on the stage, and lovers interacting with his audience. It is always his mission to get people up and dancing, laughing, and enjoying themselves at his shows. 'OGR's shows typically consist of him performing vocals over a pre-recorded backtrack, so set-up and sound are quick and simple to organize. \r\n\r\nTo hear some of OGR-Scintilla's biggest songs just search up, 'Tim's Run' or 'Canadian Baby.'

It charms with a yee-haw agenda anthem, a touching ode to her grandmother, a unique and disarming rendition of The Wallflowers’ “One Headlight” and conjures a rural highway trailer bar.

2367	The Califon Hellbenders are middle aged guys in a band, built for fun, not speed, who love playing for our friends and neighbors and celebrating our community.  \r\n\r\nWhat is a Hellbender?  Simply put, it is a type of salamander found in the eastern United States.  But the reason for this name is not our love of regional amphibians, but rather because the word just sounds like pure Rock & Roll, with an easygoing vibe that suits our persona.  \r\n\r\nThe unofficial description of our style is expressed as “good time folk-a-billy jam pop dance party rock & roll”, with unconventional instrumentation that weaves together the acoustic and electric, old timey and modern, with a pulsating undercurrent of tasty banjo ever-present.  And it suggests a certain bendy looseness of musical interpretation inherent in our exploration of favorite tunes from across pretty much any genre, with a particular soft spot for ‘80s rock & pop, ballads, B-side classic rock, the Grateful Dead, and Kenny Loggins.\r\n\r\nMostly from the fair borough of Califon (Jason Beard, Brian Goad, and Dan Hemberger), with imported bass and vocal skills via Mr. Pat Walsh from Lawrenceville, we really don’t like to travel too far.  Our roots are in our Califon community.  We play what we like, which given our collective 200 years’+ of living experience, can cover a lot of ground.  \r\n\r\nThe Hellbenders try to give people a reason to get their bodies moving, but are also known to explore the soft underbelly of music across these genres.  You’ve heard a lot of these tunes, and we’re guessing there are some you have not.  Even if you have, you may not recognize them at first.  Have fun with it!  And feel free to make a request, but don’t expect too much…these lizards enjoy their comfort zone.  All we promise is a really good time.\r\n	["music"]	[]	\N	\N	Jason Beard	2017257362	\N	t	\N	2023-01-20 01:59:32.435+00	2023-01-20 01:59:32.443+00	\N	\N	\N	[{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/califonhellbenders/"}]	Good time folk-a-billy country jam-pop dance-party rock	classic-rock	["folk","pop"]	covers	\N	\N	\N		[]

2181	Growing up in Winnipegosis, MB (which at last count boasts a population of about 617), Emma knows first-hand what it’s like to grow up country proud.\r\nAnd while she may have since moved on to bigger digs, it’s those fond hometown memories that continue to fuel the fire, and initially lit the spark on her country music career — no matter how cheesy she thinks her origin story may sound. Always a fan of singing and performing for family for as long as she can remember, it wasn’t until her sister played a certain CD on their way to Dauphin one summer that Emma truly realized what path her dreams were to take.\r\n“She wanted to listen to some Taylor Swift, and she said she thought it would love it,” the musician recalled, adding the pair had spent the money their parents had given them for the day on the disk. “Right then I knew I wanted to play her songs. So, not long after, we went to Walmart and bought a $50 guitar and my parents thought I was crazy.” \r\nWith no guitar teacher in town, Emma searched for YouTube tutorials on how to play some basic chords, and the rest is history. “I would watch those videos over and over and music really became the love of my life,” she said. “I still can’t imagine doing anything else.”\r\nIn 2016, Emma’s debut took home top spot in CMT’s Chevy Tailgate Contest, resulting in one of her original songs being featured on the Chevy Top 20, while she made a name for herself as one of the Top 4 finalists in the country.\r\nShe also got the chance to meet American country heavyweights Lady A backstage, which was nothing less than a full-circle moment. \r\nOver the past few years, Emma has continued to perform at numerous venues across the province and beyond, including an appearance at Dauphin’s Countryfest, sharing a stage with some of the country’s biggest breakout stars, Andrew Hyatt and Chris Buck Band.\r\nIn 2019, she headed to the Manitoba Country Music Awards in Winnipeg with a slew of nominations including Fans’ Choice, Female Artist and Music Video of the Year, ultimately taking home a win in the Emerging Artist category.\r\n“Everything has really solidified for me, in a way. Every time I hit the stage, I take a deep breath and can’t help but enjoy every minute,” she said. “I'm so lucky to be where I am, and I can’t wait to see what the future holds.”\r\n	["music"]	[]	\N	\N	Emma Peterson	2046471014	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1658457737/artist/2181/cover_photo.jpg	2022-07-22 02:41:28.289+00	2022-07-22 02:47:40.579+00	\N	\N	[{"index":0,"publicId":"artist/2181/hi-res/0.jpg","version":1658457758},{"index":1,"publicId":"artist/2181/hi-res/1.jpg","version":1658457830}]	[{"mediaType":"embeddedYoutube","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgMFXFtcsOM"},{"mediaType":"youtubeChannel","url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM94KvUb7_BVYqbwfQb4LuQ"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/emmapetersonmusic"},{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/emmapetersonmusic"},{"mediaType":"twitter","url":"https://www.twitter.com/emmapetersonn"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"http://www.emmapetersonmusic.com"},{"mediaType":"spotify","url":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/63SuE0LZ3YeV8aMGH3lunR?si=LTtp1CGeS4KzYNrwGWkwHw"},{"mediaType":"appleMusic","url":"https://music.apple.com/ca/artist/emma-peterson/1452011243"},{"mediaType":"soundCloud","url":"https://soundcloud.com/user-945728861-648178771/sets/just-for-the-record/s-gAg7Ks1Ix6R?utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing"}]	Consistently recognized as one of Manitoba’s most promising country stars, Emma Peterson is known not only for her captivating performances, but for a powerful voice and all too relatable lyricism.	country	["pop","singer-songwriter"]	originals	\N	PgMFXFtcsOM	\N	She/Her	["white"]

375	Close your eyes... picture where you were the first time that you heard that really, really great song... the first one that comes to mind - the song with the jangling guitars, pounding drums, thumping bass, moaning organ, three part harmonies, and the lyrics that spoke directly to you. The one that changed your life. The song, that every time you hear it, takes you back to a memory, a feeling, a love, a loss, an amazing moment time..\r\n.\r\nOpen your eyes and fast forward five, ten, fifteen or maybe even thirty years (or more).... the Brother Bicker Band is trying to recapture that memory, that feeling, that love, that loss and that amazing moment in time with every song that they play, original or cover. \r\n\r\nFeaturing Carl "Bash" Raines on drums, Patrick "Duff" Down on bass, Jeremy Hrdlicka on vocals and acoustic guitar, Tom Mogan on guitar and vocals, and Ben Ellard on keys and vocals, these five friends and band mates bring a unique and refreshing take on the "roots" rock genre, best described as "maple whiskey rock n roll" - well-aged and a little bit harsh, it may burn a little at first. It has a touch of sweetness and is uniquely Canadian. And like whiskey, the more you indulge, the more fun you have and the better you feel....and if you have too much you just may forget everything.\r\n\r\nThe band is also exploring its softer side playing acoustically as a band and as a duo and is available to play smaller more intimate venues with new "unplugged" takes on its original songs and and tasty covers.

2082	Nurdjana is a Canadian vocalist who was born and raised in the Netherlands. She’s been immersed in music ever since as a little girl she tagged along with her dad Rob de Rijcke.\r\nHe was a singer/songwriter and guitarist and when Nurdjana started singing it was only natural to start making music together.Rob was a composer of dreamy songs full of love and sadness. \r\n\r\nNurdjana and her dad won songwriter competitions, recorded music and played lots of gigs together. He was a modest man and modesty doesn’t bring fortune and fame. But that was not what he was after. He was only after poetry and that was what he found.\r\n \r\nNurdjana is a true advocate of her father’s music and after taking a break from singing when he passed away, she is back full force; determined to put her dad’s music back in the spotlight. Her sound has been described as delicate, yet soulful and jazzy.\r\n\r\n \r\nHer first EP ‘Coming Home’ will be released May 10th. All songs are written either by Rob or by the duo of father and daughter, some completed by Nurdjana after he passed away. \r\n	["music"]	[]	When I look at who listens to me on Spotify  and apple music it ranges from 25 to 45 (all genders)	\N	Nurdjana	4034935008	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1649369654/artist/2082/cover_photo.jpg	2022-04-07 22:09:44.146+00	2022-04-07 22:21:43.28+00	\N	[{"name":"ArtsPlace","date":"2021/09"},{"name":"ArtsPlace","date":"2021/11"},{"name":"SnowDaysBanff","date":"2022/01"}]	\N	[{"mediaType":"embeddedYoutube","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NrO_gLodfk"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/nurdjanamusic/"},{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/Nurdjana"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"https://nurdjana.com"},{"mediaType":"spotify","url":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/07DxduylT5OQXZmYTAI6CJ?si=z-Y75AHaSoCeY2IIFL6--Q"},{"mediaType":"appleMusic","url":"https://music.apple.com/ca/artist/nurdjana/1541508864"},{"mediaType":"soundCloud","url":"https://soundcloud.com/nurdjana-de-rijcke"},{"mediaType":"youtubeChannel","url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_wc5Ez4KAaYeJKVfqA_nbg"}]	At the beginning of the pandemic I started reimagining my late fathers music.

2158	The major outlet of one of Calgary's most prolific musicians (Cold Water, Fulfilment, GreyScreen, Stalwart Sons - among others) and artists (as a notable concrete poet of typewriter art, novelist, organizer of Starry Dynamo arts market, and label runner of Bart Records and Revolution Winter).  The self-described "full-stack folk" of Cold Water has continued to hone their idea of playing folk music really loudly, beginning as something of an alt-country band, with a hardcore pedigree filtered through a healthy dose of Canadiana. This culminated in 2015 which saw the release of their self-titled LP "Cold Water" - a collection of smoky guitars, sailing pedal steel and grovelled vocals. Powering through the pandemic and finding a solid line-up, Cold Water have recorded their "LP2" with Lorrie Matheson in late 2021, bridging that earlier moodiness into a more bombastic sound, with the charging classic rock country of "Golden Oriole", the Television-esque psyche dirge of "Cosmic Offering" or even one of the most naked expressions of the fear of been a gay teenager in the countrified "Bronze Medalion".

1771	Don’t let her age fool you, 17 years old Katelin Aragon has been performing in and around Alberta for 7 years. It all started at age 10 when she showed her parents her first original song in their living room one day. He father Phuong was so moved that he brought her to Cafe Koi the following week to sing the song in public. The reception was incredible and turns out Katelin she was a natural with no stage freight.\r\nSince then Katelin has performed at the prestigious Jack Singer Concert Hall, Bella Concert Hall, The Grey Eagle Event Center, The Edmonton Expo Center and many other events. In the mean time, Katelin continues to write music and hone her skills by busking on Stephen Avenue in the summer and the plus 15 in the winter to gage audience receptions of her music. Katelin’s music can be described as a mix of Noah Jones and Alicia Keys with a little bit of Daniel Caesar in between.

As a founding member of Calgary's own Oscill8 Electronic Performing Arts Society, I create live,  improvised, glitchy bass music, lush downtempo soundscapes, and odd techno explorations, using an ever-evolving performance engine to conjure new music into the world. I use a stand to hold my gear, requiring a minimal 3x4 footprint, power, and stereo DI input. My music is bass heavy and can range from downtempo to dance-focused.

943	Hiltz has independently released four full-length albums and two EPs since 2009. Her work as a talented singer-songwriter has landed her Folk Music Ontario’s Songs From The Heart Award (Political Category), opening slots for Canadian icons Gordon Lightfoot and Ron Hynes, Top 3 placement in a nation-wide music competition (She’s The One), a Best Folk Album nomination (Toronto Independent Music Awards) and earned her an invitation to give a TEDx talk in 2014.\r\n\r\nAfter more than three years spent absorbing literature, articles and other sources of media, as well as interviewing experts, friends, family, and fellow artists, Hiltz is sharing the music inspired by her research into anger on her latest release CALM FURY. The resulting body of work bears witness to an artist who has not only come to terms with her own anger, but who is willing to embrace it when called for.\r\n\r\nWhether through lyric-driven storytelling (Love & Retreat, Daylight Savings), harmonically dense and odd-metred jazz (Move On, Bad Cycle) or classic sounding ballads (Darling, I Suffer, As Long As You’re There), Hiltz clearly demonstrates many facets of anger across CALM FURY, all gathered under the banner of contemporary folk songwriter.

1076	Bob Donaldson grew up in Rimbey, a little town in Central Alberta. Where he was surrounded by music all the time. Family and family friends all from the east coast were always at his parent’s house with guitars, banjos, fiddles and everything that constituted an instrument. \r\n\r\nFor over 30 years of playing guitar and entertaining, you can see his musical influences in his writing style as well as his unique arrangements of traditional and not-so-traditional covers.  His music can be described as "Acoustic Music with a Twist" and of course a comedic flare.\r\n\r\nHis musical influences go from Johnny Horton, Oak Ridge Boys to Garth Brooks, Beach Boys, The Nylons, Metallica, Guns and Roses and everything in between. Bob is no stranger to the stage, whether it is opening up for the legendary Dr. Hook, headlining comedy shows with his musical comedy to performing as lead characters in musical theatre and his music and vocal directing. He is now based out of Edmonton.\r\n\r\nBob Donaldson is a singer/songwriter with over 30 years’ experience.

In June Bob was part of “Make Music Edmonton” on 124th Street, July brought about a four show run at the K-Days Beer Gardens (2 hour sets each day) where there was huge interactions and all four shows were different and suited the audience. Two of the shows were filmed as well. \r\nThe summer didn’t slow down as bookings took off.  In September Bob was chosen by the Association of Country Music in Alberta (ACMA) to represent Alberta on the national stage in Hamilton during the Canadian Country Music Association (CCMA) Country Music Week at the “ACMA at CCMA” Show Case. \r\n\r\nOctober was just as exciting as it was announced that Bob is a first-round contender for the ACMA Alberta Country Music Awards for three categories: Album of the Year, Song of the Year and Fans Choice Award. The Album of the year award is already progressed to the second round.\r\n\r\nOn October 19th Bob had the opportunity to open for Canadian Country Music artists Gord Bamford, JoJo Mason and Jade Eagleson during the “Honky Tonks and Dive Bars” tour.   \r\n\r\n2019 is no less active.

2211	Bittersweet optimism, filtered through a nostalgic future. Fiercely devoted vocals and deeply reflective lyrics elevate the alt-country and brit-pop sounds of Edmonton-based songwriter Jon Martin, as his exquisite new album ‘This Could Be Our Year’ reaches the scene.\r\n \r\nThe new album was born out of the uncertainty of 2020-21 and encapsulates a period of transformation, joy, and introspection. The collection delivers a snapshot of still life in motion, blending future nostalgia with the ache and uncertainty of tomorrow and inevitable change.\r\n\r\nFollowing an unfortunate wrist injury in 2019, doctors advised a year’s hiatus from playing guitar. Looking for a new outlet for songwriting, Jon bought an old piano and taught himself how to play. The latest album was written entirely on the newly explored keys while waiting to return to the Jon Martin and Lovers album that was put on hold during the pandemic.\r\n \r\nBoasting nine original songs, from the gentle rasp and sultry embrace of ‘Simple Things’, through the anthemic alt-Americana duet ‘Holding on for Summer’, the record showcases a deeply moving, versatile, and contemplative artist, at the peak of musical ability. The songs emerge drenched in uncertainty, passion, and possibility – reflecting on the pain, but ultimately drawing focus to the beauty and opportunity that lies ahead. \r\n \r\nConsider the trembling dedication and string-soaked gospel warmth of an anthemic title-track, shining light on the thoughts and feelings that swamped us during difficulty. Fragments of heavier rock and even grunge also seep through amidst the likes of a mighty and energising ‘Lesson of the Heart’.\r\n \r\nDeeply personal yet distinctly topical by nature, referencing the weight of relocation alongside that of vast global disquiet, ‘This Could Be Our Year’ combines fearless revelation with quickly infectious musicality. Brought to life by a plethora of musicians from around the world, Jon’s thoughtful compositions and ever-expressive vocals guide with unwavering presence.\r\n \r\nThis Could Be Our Year” was produced and mixed Jon Martin, with the exception of the first single, “Simple Things,” which was mixed by 8 x Grammy-award winning engineer Michael Brauer (Coldplay, My Morning Jacket, Paul McCartney). It was released May 27, 2022.\r\n \r\nRecently highlights include airplay on CBC Radio One, performing at the 2022 South Country Fair music festival, and being a finalist in the 2020 Jim Beam national talent search. Jon is currently performing in and around western Canada and working on the Jon Martin and Lovers album (TBR 2022/2023).

1555	Hailing from Hay River, Northwest Territories, Malcolm Camsell's love of music began with his parents and their passion for old country music. Being taken to concerts and listening to his Uncle Tommy play "Pretty Woman" on guitar, Malcolm was inspired to pick up his mom's guitar at age 14. Malcolm's earliest musical influences were Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and the alternative bands of the 1990's. In the period of 2001-2008 he became known for his presence at Northern Talent Shows, always thrilling the crowd with his rendition of Leroy Van Dyke's "The Auctioneer". Malcolm attended Columbia Academy, receiving a diploma in Digital and Analog Recording Arts in 2003. It was there he recorded/engineered/produced his first songs, including "Mahsi Cho", incorporating his mother's Native language, and "Go Home and Lie Down", reflecting on his northern, small town upbringing. Malcolm continued to cultivate his unique sound, and reached to artists such as Weird Al, Primus, Fishbone, and Frank Zappa, in honing his unique and memorable lyrical style. Malcolm did further recording in 2005, and co-founded his first band Psychedelogic in 2007, based in Grande Prairie, Alberta. Driven by groovy saxophone, pounding percussion, and a powerful female lead singer, it was Malcolm's songwriting that provided the structure of Psychedelogic's alternative funk sound. For 5 years they played various venues, functions, and battle of the bands in Grande Prairie. From Psychedelogic, Malcolm would continue on to form Firewater & Fish, a more stripped down rock quartet that featured all of Malcolm's original music. Since moving to Calgary in 2012, Malcolm has played shows in various venues and released his first album "Malcolm Camsell" in 2017. Malcolm's catalog boasts an impressive 80+ original songs, and 200+ covers, ranging from old country to classic rock to contemporary pop. Currently performing as a solo/acoustic act, Malcolm has just released his 1st EP "Camping Scitentist", and hopes to increase his presence at venues and festivals around Alberta. If you are yearning for a unique sound and a memorable artist, look for Malcolm on a stage near you!

Combining burning intensity with elegant grace and skilled composure wrapped in an electrifying blues rock veneer, the result is an unforgettable, emotionally charged musical experience that moves both body and soul, creating a lasting connection through shared experiences and love of good music.\r\n\r\nOwens’ upcoming album, Cannot Be Unheard, is an exploration of life birthed from her own relatable experiences, both good and bad, and the lessons learned along the way.

2304	Through 4 full length albums and 2 EPs Covenhoven has forged a signature style; layered acoustic arrangements that roll with momentum into orchestral peaks, accompanied by lyrics that contrast hard-won wisdom with the inherent hope of the natural world—from Big Sur to his native Colorado.\r\n\r\nCovenhoven’s latest album, IV (released in October 2021), is his most collaborative and rock forward to date—taking a producing partner in Ben Wysocki of the Fray, who also performs on the album. IV features over a dozen musicians including Grammy nominated singer-songwriter Gregory Alan Isakov, Luke Mossman of Nathaniel Rateliff & the Night Sweats, and Bluebook’s Julie Davis. \r\n\r\nBandwagon magazine writes that in IV, Covenhoven reaches “into chamber pop territory, and revealing a wider vocal range…sheltered by a gorgeous, rich string and piano accompaniment, whisks us above the campfire folk…”  \r\n\r\nCovenhoven’s live performances capture the spirit of his recordings—whether its conjuring cascading loops in his solo shows or backed by a full band—Covenhoven’s sound fills the breadth of outdoor spaces, auditoriums and club stages.

2046	Diamond Eye Jack bring the energy and power of the 1970s-era Grateful Dead to the entire catalogue of the Dead, Jerry Garcia Band and cover songs played throughout their careers.  Lead guitarist Luke Youngman masterfully evokes the essence of Jerry Garcia and the band is quickly creating a buzz for their ability to recreate that unique feeling of being at a Grateful Dead concert through their improvisational set lists, exploratory jams, crisp harmonies, and powerful rhythm section. The good vibes start from the interaction of band members on stage and emanate throughout the venue to all in attendance.

2159	Starpainter exists in the neatly carved out spaces between rock and country and pop. They are distantly familiar, like a newly met cousin, but distinctly shiny and new. They wear their influences on their sleeves, showcasing strong songwriting and an affinity for classic folk and rock. With Bury Me By My Family, they have created a record that is representative of a modern, new era of folk rock: a two-step here, a ballad there, a radio-worthy chorus in between. On this debut release, they have constructed a narrative of beauty, love, fear, and loss without seeming either too sweet or sorrowful. The songs are steeped in the tradition of prairie-born artistry with a pop sensibility that defies their youth. What it all comes down to is a carefully curated collection of fine songs that set them up for regular rotation for years to come.

I'm a member of Revv52 and ReMix: Powered by Revv52, and I often bring members of these groups to provide a new vocal harmony approach to familiar songs.

251	'I love procreation' says Robert Burton Hubele, with a smile. As a writer and performer of original blues-jazz, and a storyteller, radio commentator, children’s book author, and actor Robert Hubele has a very full life in the creative arts.\r\n\r\nRobert’s life mission, he says, is to 'create love and happiness in life’, which he does 'every way I can'.\r\n\r\nRobert Hubele is from Alberta and has a definite prairie way about him with his ability to spin a good yarn, tell an engaging, humorous story and open into a song. As a songwriter, Hubele writes about ordinary things that become extraordinary with just a little extra care. He believes that it is important to use his performances and the stage as a way to generate hope and initiate change and so he writes of the little things that can make a difference.\r\n\r\nRobert’s dad played fiddle at country barn dances and as a young boy Robert often would hold the fiddle like a guitar and try to play. Robert got his start playing music during his first job working for Canadian Pacific Railroad when his redcap friend Butch, who was one of the very few black people around, loaned him his electric guitar and amplifier.\r\nHe wrote his first song at age 21 and started an avalanche of inspiration that had him writing 5 or 6 songs a week for quite a few years. In retrospect, Robert says ‘they all were pretty bad, but I was learning to understand the mechanics of music'.\r\n\r\nRobert Hubele's earliest influence was the earthy beat and emotional impact of the blues as he played along with recordings of B.B. King, Howlinʼ Wolf, Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, and Freddie and Albert King. His introduction to jazz was next in line. This happened through Chuck Tracy, a veteran lounge musician who was Hubeleʼs roommate for a while. Listening to Chuck rehearse, Robert got turned onto music from Tom Waits, Mose Allison and Fats Waller, Bing Crosby, Dean Martin, Benny Goodman, Cab Calloway and Louis Jordan. \r\n\r\nAnd there is also an inevitable country influence in Robert's music, which was bound to happen for someone growing up in the prairies where the songs of Hank Williams, Hank Snow, and Marty Robbins are a background to life.\r\n\r\nWhen Robert first heard Bonnie Raitt in the early 70s, he absolutely had to take up dobro and learn how to make that ʻslidey sound’. Robert confesses dryly, 'I made a lot of racket for a couple of years until eventually, I got the hang of it.'\r\n\r\nOver time his high quantity was replaced by high quality. As a songwriter, he's won the 1984 Canadian Song Writing Contest and has been appointed to the Independent Song Writing Hall of Fame.\r\n\r\nRobert Hubele's unique songs and style caught the attention of the music industry in the 80s and 90s when he was packaged and marketed as a pop artist by Attic/A&M, his record company at the time. Performances on big stages throughout North America, radio airplay and video airplay on MuchMusic were frequent occurrences.\r\n#\r\nNowadays Robert Hubele makes his home in the north-west Calgary community of Tuscany, on the very edge of Calgary. He released his tenth album of original music, She Won’t Talk To Me, a collection of 11 songs themed around life, death, travel, and romance. He also released an album of children's songs and stories, The Sleepy Time King, which was written for his 5 grandchildren. His experience and skill is clear in these masterful albums which discreetly involves the listener in stories of regular folks’ travelling in and out of the celebrated state of love. \r\n\r\nRobert Burton Hubele's social songwriting technique is at its best in his New Release: She Won’t Talk To Me where it intersects with marvellous stories for what is a truly great work of art.\r\n\r\nAs a mature and engaging artist for whom music continues to be his full-time gig, Robert’s life experience runs a broad gamut of media and venues: CBC Radio guest, Host and Bandleader for numerous music clubs and songwriting events, various television performances, and movie acting. Whether he's a band-leading crooner on a big stage, in a classy nightclub with a jazz trio, or playing to intimate house concerts as a solo troubadour, Robert Burton Hubele consistently brings his engaging wit and wisdom to every performance he gives and still leaves audiences hungry for more.\r\n\r\n8 8 8	["music"]	["americana","blues","country","jazz","singer-songwriter"]	Women from 15 to 80.	\N	Robert Hubele	587-224-8897	robert@roberthubele.com	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1509558509/artist/251/cover_photo.jpg	2017-09-25 15:52:16.667+00	2022-07-19 21:31:07.413+00	Calgary-Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays day or evening.

958	Based on the last name of two ‘born and raised’ Albertan brothers, Flaysher is a CMAB Award-nominated Canadian country duo with grit in their blood harmonies and unvarnished truths in their lyrics. Inspired by artists such as Bob Seger, Dierks Bentley, Bon Jovi and Dallas Smith, Flaysher’s songs are rooted in the influence of their upbringing in small-town Airdrie, Alberta.\r\n\r\nFlaysher’s latest single, “Wild One,” has an undeniable energy and a melody you just can't help but sing along to. The track was written by Nashville heavy hitters Tebey, Emma-Lee and Karen Kosowski and produced by Dan Swinimer (Billy Currington, Tenille Townes, Madeline Merlo, Tim Hicks, to name a few). It's a feel-good song about the kind of girl you know you can't hold onto for long yet can't help but try. \r\n\r\nThe brothers have released three country singles to date (Coastin’ – 07/2021; Ride – 02/2021; Flat Broke Famous – 03/2020). Prior to expanding their sound and leaning into country, Flaysher had their start as a classic rock cover band. They performed over 200 shows in their teens and won the Olds Rock 104.5 star search contest in 2015. They released “Starting Over” in 2016, a rock EP that was bursting at the seams with the unwavering optimism and relentless vitality they had when they hit their 20’s.\r\n\r\nThese true blue-collar boys are known for their high-energy live performances. They’ve performed at the Calgary Stampede, headlined the Alberta Summer Games to an audience of over 6,000 people and sold out the King Eddy (Calgary, AB). Every time they hit the stage you can’t help but feel the passion these two brothers have for performing and lifting people up and those who are lucky enough to catch them in concert will feel enriched by a moment they won't soon forget.\r\n\r\nPlease see Flaysher's EPK for more information, including live performance videos. https://www.flaysher.ca/epk	["music"]	[]	45% female, 51% male, 4% NB/NS.

2173	The Humble Cartel is a five-piece Red Deer, Alberta, based band. Their sound runs the proverbial musical gamut, from Folk/Country to Rock, Blues, and Soul. Some songs are Pop driven and cause an involuntary tapping of your toes to the rhythm of the beat, while others are introspective ballads that often make one ponder the very meaning of their being. When the band takes the stage, it is easy to relate to the tales that often springboard from real-life experience (whether it be of love, loss, or lessons learned). It doesn’t hurt that their songs come packaged in silky-smooth, sometimes nostalgic sound waves.\r\n\r\nThis young band is already gaining quite the local following after opening for the likes of Hillsburn, Partner, Wintersleep, and Crash Test Dummies. With six singles available on all major platforms, and a newly released EP, they plan on flying a rocket into the hearts and minds of other music connoisseurs while remaining true to their down-to-earth, humble roots.\r\n\r\nStay Humble\r\nJoin the Cartel\r\n\r\n	["music"]	[]	\N	\N	Dylan		\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1658346694/artist/2173/cover_photo.jpg	2022-07-20 19:15:01.069+00	2022-07-20 19:51:35.157+00	\N	\N	\N	[{"mediaType":"embeddedYoutube","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNVJaAaEnjU&ab_channel=TheHumbleCartel"},{"mediaType":"youtubeChannel","url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4R-H9FiF5o58OXggTCGzAw"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/starlitesessions/"},{"mediaType":"tiktok","url":"https://www.tiktok.com/@thehumblecartel?lang=en"},{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/StarliteSessions/"},{"mediaType":"twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/thehumblecartel"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"https://www.starlitesessions.com/artist-of-the-day/The%20Humble%20Cartel"},{"mediaType":"spotify","url":"https://open.spotify.com/user/9bce0gptkfooxsbq7fmhryvtp?si=o1-kyY9AQNC2fYt6_h8rLg"},{"mediaType":"appleMusic","url":"https://music.apple.com/ca/artist/the-humble-cartel/1459331982"},{"mediaType":"soundCloud","url":"https://soundcloud.com/thehumblecartel"}]	Telling stories of love and loss, of trials and tribulations, Telling stories of the untold.

She loves oat milk cappuccinos, Sailor Moon, synthwave, and planning her life by the phases of the moon.\r\n\r\nRuby creates lush electronic tunes inspired as much by alt pop staples like Charli XCX and Lady Gaga as her love of 80's cartoons and video games. Ruby's tracks explore her emotional inner world through the sounds of retro synths, bitcrushed samples, pitched and chopped vocals, and a generous sprinkling of video game SFX. Accompanied on YouTube by whimsical, nostalgic visuals, Ruby's music and videos are a rare sensory delight.

1580	If opposites attract, when they do come together, you get Alex Hughes. Having been raised equally on the sounds of classic country and R&B, Alex’s take on pop-country delivers more soul and grit than one might expect from her 5’2” frame. With influences ranging from the likes of Linda Ronstadt and LeAnn Rimes to Snoop Dogg and Destiny’s Child, Alex possesses a distinct sound that weaves soulful runs into classic country melodies driven by pop beats. Regardless of whether it's time to dim the lights or turn up the bass, Alex Hughes delivers a performance that audiences won’t forget.\r\nHer latest single, “Tee Time”, released on July 15th is pure country/pop ear candy. Produced by CCMA and Juno nominated production team Justin Kudding and Spencer Cheyne, the catchy guitar hooks and empowered vocals emphasize the witty lyrics that tease a partner about spending a little too much time on the golf course and not enough time at home.\r\nHaving recently finished as a Top 12 finalist in Project WILD, a country-focused artist development program run by Alberta Music and WILD 95.3 FM (Calgary), and after a busy summer touring, including 3 shows at the infamous Calgary Stampede Nashville North Stage, Alex continues to make her presence in Canadian Country Music undeniable.\r\nFor more information please visit: www.alexhughes.com\r\n	["music"]	[]	age 25+	\N	Alex Hughes	4039718425	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1658466272/artist/1580/cover_photo.jpg	2020-06-11 15:15:29.894+00	2022-07-22 05:04:33.817+00	\N	[{"name":"Nashville North - Calgary Stampede","date":"2022/07"},{"name":"BlueJay Sessions Cross - Country CCMA London Showcase","date":"2021/11"},{"name":"WildFest opening for Aaron Pritchett - Virtual Show","date":"2020/02"}]	[{"index":0,"publicId":"artist/1580/hi-res/0.jpg","version":1591888856},{"index":1,"publicId":"artist/1580/hi-res/1.jpg","version":1591888889},{"index":2,"publicId":"artist/1580/hi-res/2.jpg","version":1591888908}]	[{"mediaType":"embeddedYoutube","url":"https://youtu.be/vTMlxL6bO7c"},{"mediaType":"youtubeChannel","url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0d-losy4EKhj8M-1Y2-jmQ?view_as=subscriber"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/alexhughesmusic"},{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/alexhughesofficial"},{"mediaType":"twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/alexhughesmusic"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"http://alexhughes.com"},{"mediaType":"spotify","url":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/6iL96eq4EA2eoFI9CzyJgI"},{"mediaType":"appleMusic","url":"https://music.apple.com/ca/artist/alex-hughes/291730800"},{"mediaType":"soundCloud","url":"https://soundcloud.com/alexhughes-2/close-the-door "},{"mediaType":"bandcampArtist","url":"https://alexandriahughes.bandcamp.com"},{"mediaType":"tiktok","url":"https://www.tiktok.com/@alexhsings?lang=en"},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"http://alexandriahughes.bandcamp.com/track/strong-as-you","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"133868333"}},{"mediaType":"bandcamp","url":"https://alexandriahughes.bandcamp.com/track/run-free","metadata":{"type":"track","id":"3002705536"}}]	Alberta based Country Pop Recording Artist, Alex Hughes	country	["pop","rb"]	originals	\N	vTMlxL6bO7c	\N	She/Her	["other-race","female"]

1649	The barstool balladeer: a charming and mysterious legend recalling better days, better songs, in better bars. A figure cloaked in experience, in heartbreak and all-consuming empathy, this trope seeks hope and light over all else. In today’s imitative mass of simple melodies and bubblegum production - Ryan Langlois’ rock-ribbed growl is an uncompromising breath of fresh air. \r\nAnthemic in delivery, Langlois recalls an impassioned Springsteen-esque leader, but one with decidedly more gospel and soul influences than his predecessors. He plays a character in and of himself, somehow weaving the fantastic and unimaginable with the humble and sincere. His songwriting spans roots, country, and Americana influences; often flourishing a simple idea into complex nuance. \r\nFormerly fronting the multiple-award-winning Boom Chucka Boys, Langlois is no stranger to the stage. Long renowned for his performances carrying unprecedented electricity, he is a master of his surroundings, regardless of the space. The songs hold heavy in a soft-seater venue of attentive listeners. With full accompaniment, he boasts an exhilarating experience of country-rock, folk, and storytelling, backed by Canada’s best musicians. \r\nAnd now, after his extensive culmination of experience and wisdom, Langlois finds himself on the move with some impressive momentum for his solo endeavors. After securing a sizable development award as part of Project WILD Country (Alberta), he spared no expense investing every penny into growing his career. From creativity to a live show strategy, Ryan has built his audience and trajectory passionately, one song at a time. \r\nWith soul-revealing, vulnerable tracks like “Light and Dark”, we know that Langlois is as ambitious as he is raw. We can hear “This Is My Home” among the rubble of concrete side-streets and the alleyways of nostalgia, beckoning us both back towards the comforting and ahead into the unknown. These earnest laments are what keep us human and grounded, and Langlois knows them well. His conviction and authenticity place him firmly among a class of performer that has consistently earned and continues to seek his stripes. With a voice true and persevering, this barstool balladeer is bound for bigger stages. \r\n	["music"]	[]	30+	\N	Ryan Langlois	4033963336	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1658674311/artist/1649/cover_photo.jpg	2020-06-19 12:54:40.284+00	2022-07-24 14:55:31.861+00	I am available.

2206	Like the yellow morning sun inviting fields of sunflowers to turn toward her, Jessica Pearson naturally draws her listeners in. Whether you are at a Jessica Pearson & the East Wind live show or enjoying her musical offerings through your bluetooth speaker, you are sure to feel the sunny warmth she so effortlessly conveys. \r\n \r\nThere is a grounded current of energy that runs through Pearson’s music and connects with her audience. It feels like bare feet planted on an old hardwood floor. It smells like fields of heather on a foggy day.  \r\n \r\nHer love for storytelling, drawing on folk, outlaw country, and Celtic traditions, is evident in her songwriting. The stories she tells are like lovingly-sewn patchwork quilts, stitched together by soul-stirring melodies and gorgeous modern folk-country arrangements. They are the quilts you spread out under the stars, and the ones you wrap yourself in all winter long. These stories, with their frayed edges, become more beautiful the longer you sit with them. \r\n\r\nIn 2021, Pearson received the Folk Music Ontario ‘Songs from the Heart’ award for her song Ready My Heart. She was also selected for Global Music Match, a program created to connect artists internationally on social media platforms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Jessica Pearson & the East Wind was also nominated for ‘Group of the Year’ at the 2021 Capital Music Awards. Pearson’s forthcoming album has been nominated for ‘Album of the Year’ at the 2022 Faces Ottawa Awards.\r\n \r\nHer long-awaited debut album On The Line was released on  January 21, 2022 through Willow Sound Records, to a sold out crowd.

1157	Cold Little Crow is a songwriting, storytelling venture of Whitehorse, Yukon’s Christina Renee. Over the years, her solo offerings have been performed under several monikers, though the songs themselves – somber, minor key with a touch of swaying folk –have always carried her unique character. Mid-2019 brought a strong focus to one outlet; Cold Little Crow.\r\n\r\nIn Spring 2019, Cold Little Crow released a debut EP. In the time since the project has grown to include other members dedicated to complimenting what’s already on the table. Warm acoustic melodies are now built upon by some Telecaster twang, mandolin and a solid rhythm section, comprised of musicians, friends and those you can share a drink with. \r\n\r\n2021 saw the release of 'Come & Go' recorded at Echobase Studios in Calgary.

We feel the music, and want people to experience our songs in the way that they feel is fitting. Chat with a friend, dance uncontrollably, have an Old Fashioned (neat), or lay quietly, motionless, focusing on each and every syllable and note. We bring in a variety of our past and present experiences, music tastes, and personalities. We’re a blend of classically trained instrumentalists, leaning on our jazz, soul, & folk inspirations like Typhoon, Dan Mangan, Hiatus Kaiyote & Christian Scott. Alongside Juno Award nominee, Nils Mikkelsen (AM Static), we have created a six song EP that will showcase the bands groovy and soulful new sound.

2221	With their feet on the ground and their toes in the mystic river, the cosmic cowboys of Liquor Mountain temper their alt-country leanings with a firm dose of rock & roll energy. Led by the duo of Danny Vescarelli and Steve Rozitis and hailing from diverse acts in and around Calgary, members bring along a DIY aesthetic as they follow the time-honoured practice of forward-thinking bands taking a page from traditional music, blending a Western songwriting style with modern psych and garage to craft a synthesis of styles. In 2020 the band was fortunate to write and produce a brand new track for The Sled Island Lemonade Stand albums, after having also performed at the 2019 edition of the festival. The group’s downright-fun live show has seen them cover the prairies from Edmonton to Saskatoon to Lethbridge, while at home they celebrated their 2021 return to the stage along with the release of The Palomino’s vinyl compilation, featuring their song “Lost Time.” With this handful of recently released singles and plans for a full-length album in the works, Liquor Mountain is primed to be the soundtrack for a whole plethora of foggy memories.

This group of tenured Troubadours are led by Calgary’s charismatic Métis stargazer Memphis Pambrun. All the members came from a diverse background of bands to build a group that showcases years of experience.

I’m really drawn to people who can express themselves in making music. There are people who just like one genre! But I’m aiming to get to the heart of something. Really, When you making a music; you’re making an emotion, a feeling, that singular moment, It’s about sharing something, expressing something you have felt, it can be a turn of phrase or a melody.”,\r\n\r\nAlso In continue this way Kamibekami has make a record label in 2019 under the name “NRL RECORDS”, He believes it will be a starting point for electronic producers who want to bring their work to a wide range of Electornic Dance Music lovers.\r\n\r\nIn The Future\r\n\r\nKamibekami has been globally acclaimed for his such creations with extraordinary musical tracks including the singles like Hybrid (2020), Rain Drops (2006). these musical creations, all marked departure from the traditional ones, played a major role in making Kamibekami a global public figure. This can be understood from the fact that his large number of followers are always ready for the announcement from him for his next number or single.\r\n\r\nKamibekami has recently released an attractive playlist of his latest music on Spotify, Some of its most popular music are: “unlimited”, “Firewall”, “Storm”; He will bring out their next EP, ‘Firewall’, on 13 November 2021, a super energetic Album about soul growing up, infused with the Electronic, Deep House soundscapes that we have come to expect from them.

1909	Alberta’s Renegade Station embarks on a dynamic musical journey that sees the talented quartet elevating their already impressive reputation for creative excellence and superior showmanship to new heights.\r\nUnderstanding that sometimes you need to shed elements of your past in order to embrace the wide, wonderful future, the group changed its name and has revitalized and focused their musical identity. They have pushed forward with a passion, and unrelenting drive that will see Renegade Station become a name that anyone hearing their unique pop and rock-infused brand of country music is unlikely to forget.\r\nTheir name is symbolic of the group’s unconventional approach to their music and sense of independence. They are unabashed about injecting their original music and the songs presented to them by other noted songwriters with healthy doses of pop and classic rock nuances – with a focus on lushly produced and beautiful layered vocal harmonies which owe as much to Fleetwood Mac as they do to Lady Antebellum.\r\n \r\nThe rock-solid foundation that was built is not being shunted aside as the talented quartet moves forward. Renegade Station’s legacy is etched deep into the firmament of the western Canadian music scene and that can never be taken from them. In recent years they have won back to back Association of Country Music in Alberta, as Group of the Year (2015 and 2016), the ACMA Fan’s Choice of the Year in 2015 and the ACMA Single of the Year for WHO’S GONNA LOVE ME TONIGHT. They also garnered a CCMA nomination for songwriter of the year for their tune 2:15 and Luanne was also nominated for CCMA Bass Player of the Year for 2016.

2277	Joze is a singer songwriter from Montreal, Quebec who has spent time in Atlanta, Los Angeles, Toronto & Calgary developing his sound as an artist. Joze fuses pop, funk, hip hop and soul in a way that brings together people, cultures and art with a universal, unboxable & unique vibe.\r\n\r\nHis father, a pastor and guitar player and his mother a soprano, Joze found his inspiration for music at a young age. As a family, the three would fuse Backstreet Boys melodies with gospel hymns and would open Joze's mind to the endless possibilities that all music holds.\r\n\r\nWhile this spark a deep connection with music, it wasn't until he was overheard by Stacy, a fellow parishioner, while singing at church that he would start his path to a career in music. She would push him to join the choir and three months later, he was the lead tenor. He had found his voice and the artist within was awoken.\r\n\r\nIn his early twenties, Joze decided to take his talents to Los Angeles and pursue his dream of becoming a full time artist. During that period of his life, he busked until his fingers bled, slept in his car for months and hit the low point when he was swindled out of his entire savings by someone posing to be the landlord for an apartment. That event inspired the first track - Supposed To Go - from his debut EP. It was written during the one night he was able to stay in the apartment.\r\n\r\nWhile the experience in LA was difficult and didn't have the exact outcome he had set out to achieve, he was able to connect with many amazing people and play a show for a packed house at the Viper Room on sunset strip.\r\n\r\nIKIGAI Vol. I includes 3 other tracks, Dive Inside & For You, are personal tracks dedicated to his grandmother. Joze credits his family for him being able to pursue his dreams and often serve as inspiration behind the music he creates. The final track is one of the first songs Joze ever wrote, Duck Going Down the River. It offers the profound but simple insight that sometimes things are meant to make you grow.\r\n	["music"]	[]	\N	\N	Jose Deverze	4389985693	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1667326366/artist/2277/cover_photo.jpg	2022-10-13 12:43:50.755+00	2022-11-29 23:27:53.001+00	Joze is available anyday and anytime.

2292	Chandler Berardi is an independent artist born and raised in Ontario. Growing up in a house full of music, she discovered her passion for singing and performing at a very young age. Throughout her life, Chandler used music as her therapy. Writing became instrumental in overcoming lost friendships, heartbreaks, and more recently, understanding her inner self. Influenced by the country music she was raised on, the pop music she grew up with and the other independent artists she spends most of her time now discovering, her music explores multiple genres. Over the years it has become less important where her music fits, and more about who it reaches. Chandler hopes to make her listeners feel the way she feels when hearing the artists that have spent so much time shaping the musician she is today.

1697	The Dust Collectors are proof that sometimes what you’re looking for is right in front of you all along. After years of playing separately in different bands, the four-piece evolved organically, quickly moving from garage jams to song-writing in a matter of weeks. By Winter 2018, they were recording their first Demos EP and playing shows around the local Calgary circuit.\r\n\r\nThe group approach songwriting as a collaborative effort. With each member coming from different places of influence, the result is a blend of country, folk and rock that is both bitter and sweet to the listener's ears, bringing to mind classic collectives like The Band and CSNY. What truly sets this band apart is that each member contributes vocally; sharing lead-singer responsibilities and seamless four-part harmonies have become the signature of their ever-increasing setlist of original songs.\r\n\r\nThe Dust Collectors are currently working on their first album, recording with Pat Palardy at Public Lunch Studios in Calgary. Their first single, Take A Dive, was released in November 2022. They have an EP release scheduled for Feb 2023 and a full length album will be released in the Spring of 2023.\r\n\r\nThe Dust Collectors are:\r\nMatt - Guitar, Vocals\r\nSteve - Bass, Vocals\r\nScott - Drums - Vocals\r\nLuke - Guitar, Mandolin, Keys, Vocals	["music"]	[]	University Students, Bar-going people, fans of original music	\N	Luke Giblin	4038262353	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1668695696/artist/1697/cover_photo.jpg	2020-07-15 22:30:33.481+00	2022-11-17 14:44:09.964+00	Interested in festivals or live shows in Western Canada, with a main focus on Southern Alberta (Calgary, Red Deer, Lethbridge, Drumheller, Canmore, Banff, etc.)	[{"name":"The Ship & Anchor","date":"2022/11"},{"name":"Ironwood","date":"2022/09"},{"name":"South Block","date":"2022/10"}]	[{"index":0,"publicId":"artist/1697/hi-res/0.jpg","version":1629256600},{"index":1,"publicId":"artist/1697/hi-res/1.jpg","version":1668695742},{"index":2,"publicId":"artist/1697/hi-res/2.jpg","version":1668695804}]	[{"mediaType":"embeddedYoutube","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-hZeLJsL18"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/thedustcollectorsmusic/"},{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/thedustcollectorsmusic"},{"mediaType":"soundCloud","url":"https://soundcloud.com/thedustcollectors"},{"mediaType":"bandcampArtist","url":"https://thedustcollectors.bandcamp.com"},{"mediaType":"youtubeChannel","url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSlWKKCJuq_lATT2Zvo4_dg"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"http://thedustcollectors.com"},{"mediaType":"spotify","url":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/5VLk7YtV92tDnZBL5YtYeG?si=w3AjhdxnRpSWTTPb1jkrsA"}]	The Dust Collectors are an alternative folk 4-piece from Calgary, AB, Canada.

560	\tTransplanted from Colorado to Black Diamond, Alberta, singer/songwriter Al “Doc” Mehl traces his family roots to central Kansas, where his grandfather raised six children on the family homestead. With one foot in the past and one in the present, Doc weaves the history and the mystery of the West into his original “west-clectic” music and his spoken-word cowboy poetry presentations.  His CD recordings of original music include  “Asphalt Cowboy” (2005), “I’d Rather Be…” (2008), and “Doc & Tub, Live”  (2014), a live recording featuring the duo of Doc Mehl and his sidekick Washtub Jerry accompanied by the 70-voice Littleton (Colorado) Chorale.   Doc’s spoken-word poetry recordings include “Cowboy Pottery” (2005) and “The Great Divide” (named “Cowboy Poetry CD of the Year” in 2013 by both the Western Music Association and the Academy of Western Artists).  In 2021 Doc published "Good Medicine," his first collection of original cowboy poetry, and in 2022 Doc released two new full-length CDs of original music, "Tried and True" and "West of the 22."  Doc Mehl’s poems and musical lyrics have been featured on the website cowboypoetry.com, and his poems have been published in “Rattle” magazine.  Songwriter Jon Chandler comments, “Listening to Doc is like having Lyle Lovett in one ear and Tommy Smothers in the other!”  And in the words of Rick Huff, as published in The Western Way magazine, “There’s a unique mind at work here that may be one of a kind in the Western Music arena."\r\n	["music"]	[]	For listeners ranging from school age up to senior care facility, the family-friendly themes of Doc's original songs are universal. 	\N	Al "Doc" Mehl	403-369-7430	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1539543896/artist/560/cover_photo.jpg	2018-06-11 02:45:56.762+00	2022-10-29 16:44:27.853+00	\N	[{"name":"\\"On the Edge\\" Concert Series, Red Deer Lake United Church; Calgary, Alberta","date":"2022/03"},{"name":"\\"Diamond Music Fest;\\" Black Diamond Alberta","date":"2022/07"},{"name":"Okotoks Food Bank Benefit Christmas Concert; Okotoks, Alberta","date":"2021/12"}]	[{"index":0,"publicId":"artist/560/hi-res/0.jpg","version":1539545206},{"index":1,"publicId":"artist/560/hi-res/1.jpg","version":1539545234},{"index":2,"publicId":"artist/560/hi-res/2.jpg","version":1539545254}]	[{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/DocMehl/"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"http://docmehl.com/"},{"mediaType":"youtubeChannel","url":"https://www.youtube.com/user/almehlasphaltcowboy"}]	"Listening to Doc Mehl is like having Lyle Lovett in one ear, and Tommy Smothers in the other!"

1777	At the intersection of rock and roll, alternative, indie, R&B, and country lies Cheyanne Summer. As a musical omnivore and passionate songstress, Cheyanne has been hearing and interpreting diverse genres since she decided to sing, which imbues a timeless quality to her music and encourages a broad variety of collaborators, styles, and production techniques with every release. Despite her folksy roots, she’s not afraid to make bold creative decisions, which leads to a sultry, moody, jazz-inflected hip hop tune like iSpy; conversely, she can turn on her alternative charm with a song like Circles, an emotive and vulnerable song which takes her vocals all over her expressive soprano range. Beyond musical recordings and performance, Cheyanne Summer has been a regular in digital print and on the radio, with features from CBC Radio 1 to The Calgary Guardian to 10at10 Calgary, and radio play on CJSW, X92.9, and CKUA. Thanks to her hustle and drive she’s found herself co-producing and curating festivals such as Inspire Fest 2022, and co-founding a label, Peach Jam Records, to further entrench herself into the business side of the music industry. As her first few singles and releases have hit worldwide platforms, Cheyanne’s drive and motivation has continued to bring new collaborators into her diverse projects. As her total on-demand streams on Spotify and reach on global digital charts both soar, industry stalwarts like Brian Joseph Dobbs (Bon Jovi, Metallica, AC/DC) and Roy Hamilton III (Britney Spears, N’Sync, Michael Jackson) have found themselves drawn to Cheyanne’s dynamic flame, and with every release, production, show, and event, her fan base, and career will continue to grow in lockstep with her releases and repertoire.\r\n	["music"]	[]	Teens, University Students, 14 years-70 years	\N	Cheyanne Perrett	2502150267	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1629503661/artist/1777/cover_photo.jpg	2020-11-16 21:47:36.08+00	2022-09-14 02:07:16.168+00	All Time	[]	[{"index":0,"publicId":"artist/1777/hi-res/0.jpg","version":1660757279},{"index":1,"publicId":"artist/1777/hi-res/1.jpg","version":1629503674},{"index":2,"publicId":"artist/1777/hi-res/2.jpg","version":1629503682}]	[{"mediaType":"embeddedYoutube","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NS8X7VIlZ0Q"},{"mediaType":"youtubeChannel","url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCju16ewnr-qLLf0QwK5LL3g"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/cheyannesummerofficial/"},{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/cheyannesummermusic"},{"mediaType":"website","url":"https://www.peachjamrecords.com/cheyanne-summer-press-kit"},{"mediaType":"spotify","url":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/0jqHSRjjCNKJZvIJAi6nqL?si=x63pf81TSjeWbbEIqIW1xg"},{"mediaType":"appleMusic","url":"https://music.apple.com/ca/artist/cheyanne-summer/1565427842"},{"mediaType":"twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/cheyanne_summer"},{"mediaType":"bandcampArtist","url":"https://cheyannesummer.bandcamp.com/?from=viewsite_dashboard"}]	At the intersection of rock and roll, alternative, indie, R&B, and country lies Cheyanne Summer.	alternative	["indie-rock","pop"]	originals	\N	NS8X7VIlZ0Q	\N		["white","female"]

2305	We are a six-piece band on a mission to pack your dance floor and bring the glamour and professional approach of a Las Vegas stage show, featuring  multiple, glamorous costume options. And we love to involve your guests in the fun! Having played nearly 2,000 shows (across Canada and around the world, touring the U.S., Europe and Japan) our repertoire is huge. Our mission is to pack every dance floor and ensure your guests are talking about your amazing function for years! We started as an original swing and cocktail party, so we can switch gears from Las Vegas cocktail lounge favourites, to country, hard rock, and of course the latest hits. If something isn't working we'll find what your audience wants - unlike many other hired-gun, party bands who hold your party hostage with the charts they were given for that night! Finally, we elevate your event, because we're used to the big stage. We’ve played for some of the world’s largest corporations and household names including Tom Hanks, Glenn Frey, Bill Clinton and even members of the Japanese Royal Family.

2307	Lipstick Party is a femme-forward, predominantly queer local band (Calgary, AB) known for turning every gig into a party - you’ll often find members of Lipstick Party decked in glitter, distributing balloons or party hats before taking the stage. Formed in 2022 by Erin Maddock (lead vocals, she/her), Kristin Evans (guitar, she/her), Ruby Swan (lead vocals, she/her), and Siân Alcorn (guitar, she/her), with a rhythm section comprised of P.A.C.C. members Andrés Mira (drums, he/him) and Abijah Knight (bass, they/them), their powers combine to create a highly engaging blend of pop punk hooks, vocal harmonies, ambient guitar melodies, and moody, groovy rhythms. \r\n \r\nWith songs written by Erin, Kristin, and Ruby, Lipstick Party’s songbook is dynamic and varied, influenced by artists across a range of genres, such as Basement, Thrice, blink-182, Metric, early Katy Perry, My Chemical Romance, and PVRIS. Tackling subjects from relationship complications and mental health issues to prescription drugs and psychedelics, Lipstick Party’s lyricism stems from the lived experience of its band members, creating tracks that are intimate, authentic, and relatable. \r\n \r\nWhen developing new songs, each member of Lipstick Party brings something to the table to create their signature sound. Erin and Ruby establish dual vocal parts, with Ruby composing harmonies inspired by artists Lucius and Oh Wonder, and Erin pin-pointing moments for audience engagement and added dimension within the song structure. Kristin diligently crafts catchy hooks, driving rhythms, and spicy solos, while Siân adds layers of ambience, incorporating silvery riffs and looping melodies inspired by Alan Sparhawk (Low), Julien Baker, and Rafiq Bhatia (Son Lux).\r\n \r\nThe summer of 2022 has been kind to Lipstick Party, who kicked off the season joining Gratuitous Platypus for their album release party at Dickens Pub. No stranger to Calgary’s beloved Rockin’ 4 Dollar$, Lipstick Party captured the hearts of the community creating and hosting the inaugural Rockin’ 4 Dollar$ “Queer and Here All Year” celebration. Additionally, the band performed at Art Spot and the Downtown Association’s outdoor free form art festival “Expresstival”. Lipstick Party has been blessed to play on the bill alongside local legends In Search of Sasquatch, Good Grief, Less Miserable, What’s the Plan, and Try the Fish. \r\n \r\nEager to continue their quest to takeover Calgary’s local music scene, Lipstick Party is currently planning a cute and queer Halloween event at Kaffeeklatsch and are looking to release their debut EP in 2023.\r\n	["music"]	[]	LGBTQ+, Family Friendly, All Ages, 	\N	Erin Maddock	4037026088	\N	t	https://res.cloudinary.com/luminlife/image/upload/v1668995362/artist/2307/cover_photo.jpg	2022-11-21 01:44:43.897+00	2022-11-21 02:02:27.873+00	\N	[{"name":"Kaffeeklatsch","date":"2022/10"},{"name":"Broken City","date":"2022/08"},{"name":"Dickens","date":"2022/06"}]	[{"index":0,"publicId":"artist/2307/hi-res/0.jpg","version":1668995409},{"index":1,"publicId":"artist/2307/hi-res/1.jpg","version":1668995487}]	[{"mediaType":"embeddedYoutube","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdOJHrREAk0"}]	Lipstick Party is a femme-forward, predominantly queer local band (Calgary, AB) known for turning every gig into a party.\r\n	alternative	["pop","punk"]	originals	\N	kdOJHrREAk0	\N		["lgbtq-plus"]

2314	Nicolette can recall having a microphone in hand from a young age. Her early influences of Shania Twain, Fleetwood Mac, The Chicks and James Taylor had her falling in love with acoustic and country music from the start.\r\nGrowing up in Ontario, she competed in singing competitions all over the GTA in her teens, completed her Royal Conservatory Voice certification and obtained a degree in Musical Theatre from Randolph College for the Performing Arts. \r\nNicolette has pursued many avenues in the arts after studying that triple threat program but ultimately knew that singing was her biggest passion. In her journey to pursue a vocal career wholeheartedly, she began learning guitar and taking songwriting classes to find herself as a solo artist. \r\n\r\nSince moving to Calgary in 2020, she has performed in venues such as The King Eddy, been featured on CJSW's "Off The Map", as well as recorded and released her first single earlier this year. Her first single “Consolation Prize” is an honest, heart on her sleeve, representation of the music she delivers to audiences. With inspiration from Maren Morris, Tenille Townes and Sara Bareilles, you can expect music from Nicolette that tells a story. \r\nNicolette is currently working towards releasing more singles, followed by an EP, while performing throughout Calgary sharing her voice.

1595	Hello. I'm Esteban Herrera, pianist, composer, arranger, producer and music director originally from Mexico, living in Calgary, Canada.

I studied at the Music Conservatory of the State of Mexico, at the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, at the National Institute of Fine Arts of Mexico and at Ambrose University of Calgary. I have 30 years of professional experience as a full time musician. I have shared music with several artists in many jazz venues all around Mexico, USA, Canada, Spain, Italy, Germany, France and Latin America.

Hayley is now 11 and loves performing, writing songs and working on her music. \r\n\r\nHey, I'm Hayley Isabel.\r\nI have always been and always will be obsessed with music. I've been singing ever since I could remember, meaning belting out Taylor Swift and Carrie Underwood (my mentors) songs in the back of the car as loud as I could and performing for my family! From a very young age my mom put me into every activity to see what I gravitated towards; what my mom didn't notice is that on the way to everything I was singing along to every song on the radio. Shortly later at age 6 I started piano lessons; that's when my love for music really took off! My life revolves around music. So far I've finished writing 5 original songs and am working on more. Music has always brought me so much joy and I hope it brings you the same amount of joy listening to me!

2351	Part-Time Custodian is an indie rock band from New Jersey.  In a short period of time they have built a diverse catalog of songs that have caught the ear of new fans across the tri-state area.   Some have said their sound has a Counting Crows/Wallflowers vibe.  Totally fine with that.  Mike has a degree in English Lit  (nice call) and Joe is married to a Librarian, so perhaps the best way to define their sound is "Language Arts Rock".  They will be releasing their second EP in Spring of 2023 and touring in support of it throughout the Northeast.  	["music"]	[]	Lates 20-earlys 30s.   Late 40s and above.
