I try not to book people too often so have to decline this request, try back in the 2nd quarter next year.  We do have a singer/songwriter night and I would be happy to hook you up with the hosts if you like.  They play Thursday's and invite guests to play original songs in the round.  Let me know if that is of interest.  Cheers and good health.  Andy	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	event

These are a few of the personalities that have been blown away by Toney's music.\r\nToney aka Wild T took his name from his home town of Tunapuna Trinidad, though one may find similarities to Jimi Hendrix, Lenny Kravitz & Eric Gales ironically it was Toney's exposure to Steve Howe (Yes) that inspired him to pick up guitar.\r\nMoving to Toronto in his early teens, Toney quickly gained a reputation in the mid 80's... After being in Toronto for a few years Toney was voted best guitarist at the Canadian Black Music awards and has not looked back since. Jeff Healey saw a man with endless imagination, a man who could combine that imagination with an emotion that you couldn't help but feel. "I followed him around like he was a Messiah, I probably learned more from Toney than anybody else, Toney's been my idol for years" said Jeff Healy.\r\nJeff Healey wasn't the only one who noticed Toney's rapid ascension through the ranks. David Bowie chose Toney to be his guitarist on his Black Tie White Noise album after seeing Toney's video for 'Midnight Blues' on a tv show while in Montreal with Tin Machine (Bowie's Supergroup), subsequently Toney appeared with Bowie on Jay Leno, David Letterman & Arsenio Hall & on Bowie's making of Black Tie White Noise dvd prominently showcasing Toney.... "an absolute delight to work with" said Bowie.\r\nThe spiritual karma exchanged with his audiences has given Toney a tremendous reputation for firey live performances.\r\nwww.wildtandthespirit.com	$20.00 advanced	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	manual	\N	https://blindbeggar.ca/buy-tickets/	\N	\N	\N	event

These are a few of the personalities that have been blown away by Toney's music.\r\nToney aka Wild T took his name from his home town of Tunapuna Trinidad, though one may find similarities to Jimi Hendrix, Lenny Kravitz & Eric Gales ironically it was Toney's exposure to Steve Howe (Yes) that inspired him to pick up guitar.\r\nMoving to Toronto in his early teens, Toney quickly gained a reputation in the mid 80's... After being in Toronto for a few years Toney was voted best guitarist at the Canadian Black Music awards and has not looked back since. Jeff Healey saw a man with endless imagination, a man who could combine that imagination with an emotion that you couldn't help but feel. "I followed him around like he was a Messiah, I probably learned more from Toney than anybody else, Toney's been my idol for years" said Jeff Healy.\r\nJeff Healey wasn't the only one who noticed Toney's rapid ascension through the ranks. David Bowie chose Toney to be his guitarist on his Black Tie White Noise album after seeing Toney's video for 'Midnight Blues' on a tv show while in Montreal with Tin Machine (Bowie's Supergroup), subsequently Toney appeared with Bowie on Jay Leno, David Letterman & Arsenio Hall & on Bowie's making of Black Tie White Noise dvd prominently showcasing Toney.... "an absolute delight to work with" said Bowie.\r\nThe spiritual karma exchanged with his audiences has given Toney a tremendous reputation for firey live performances.\r\nwww.wildtandthespirit.com	$20.00 advanced	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	manual	\N	https://blindbeggar.ca/buy-tickets/	\N	\N	\N	event

13927	1612	28	7952	TOM PHILLIPS with Kit Johnson & Tim Leacock	\N	\N	The tradition continues at the Ironwood in the Age of Aquarium. Tom Phillips takes the Casat Deck at the Ironwood for the 13th year in a row on Parade Day, joined this year by Kit Johnson and Tim Leacock. Due to limited seating and social distancing requirements, reservations are required. 20$ cover charge. Call 403-269-5581 for reservations. Shine up your boots and come on down!!!\r\n\r\nNow more about Tom...\r\n\r\nTOM PHILLIPS Calgary, Alberta Band leader. Honky-tonk hero. Even soundtrack writer for a book (a Canadian first, for a Will Ferguson novel.) Survivor and singer of cautionary tales. You want it, you got it from Tom Phillips, whose career’s turned itself inside out so often that at times he appears to be a shape shifter. During the past few years, Phillips’ transformation was also physical as he swapped alcohol for coffee and his trademark cowboy boots and shirts for polished shoes and tailored suits. But appearances distract, and Phillips is no shape shifter: if you took a musical x-ray during every incarnation, you’d find song writing as the bedrock under the suits, boots, cowboy hats and skin. Which explains why revered blues artist Eric Bibb covered Phillips’ touchstone tune, Ribbons and Bows, on one of his albums. An esteemed statesperson of the Calgary music scene, Phillips earned his laurels over decades. He recorded with Gordon Lightfoot’s band in Toronto before releasing several albums, both live and in studio, with his legendary long time honky-tonk band The Men of Constant Sorrow (MOCS). He also released an acoustic solo album, paid homage to Hank Williams on the Sorrow Bound project, and smashed his comfort zone with a daring, darling album of cover songs from punk and rock territory. He’s often found anchoring musical gatherings that celebrate the songs of Haggard, Dylan, Springsteen and Lightfoot. \r\n\r\nThe evolution continues on his most recent work with the D.T.’s (Difficult Transitions). The band formed serendipitously at bars and open stages, learning Phillips’ most recent songs onstage just in time for his last record. With MOCS veteran Tim Leacock (The Co-Dependents), Ian Grant (Art Bergmann, Cat Ranch), Geoff Brock and sisters Shaye and Sydney Zadravec, the D.T.’s translate Phillips’ songs into live performances that deliver musical delights which offer style without flash. So take a musical walk with Phillips and gaze at life through his seasoned eyes. He’s got it covered with a hundred songs that undress truths so simple they’re frightening. \r\n\r\nEver cheated on a lover, driven home drunk, been bucked off your horse, or been the last person in the bar when the lights came up? If you’ve been stranded on the highway, woken up in the wrong bed, walked home barefoot in a ball gown in the morning rain, or wished you could have a re-do on any of these choices, Phillips has a song for you. -  MLW   https://www.tomphillipsmusic.com/	$20	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	manual	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	event

She loves to croon old country like Dolly, Willie, Cline, Cash and Wilf Carter. Elle works as a Music Therapist in Calgary and loves to sing songs that she doesn't have to sing for work. Songwriting is a form of catharsis for Elle. What you see is what you get, no phoney business here.	Artist accepts tips	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	manual	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	event

In this virtual special event hosted by JD Lewis, and brought to you by Give A Mile, Blue Flame Kitchen, Village Brewery, and Cask Global Canning Solutions, you’ll enjoy live music by Pat Moore, delicious food and local beer.\r\n\r\nProceeds from this event will go to Give A Mile, a charity which provides flights for people to visit with a loved one who is critically ill or dealing with palliative illness.  This holiday season we are looking to give 25 flights away.\r\n\r\nDuring this event, you will enjoy a three-course meal provided by Blue Flame Kitchen with Village Brewery beer paired with each course. Don’t eat too quickly, as there will be a chef demonstration that will go along your main course with none other than Blue Flame Kitchen's chef Darcy!\r\n\r\nYou’ll hear speeches from sponsors, connect with community and ultimately give to a great cause.		\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	manual	\N	https://shop.atco.com/pages/cooking-up-christmas-flights	Give a Mile 	\N	\N	\N

14536	\N	170	8141	Alberta Spotlight - Holiday Edition	\N	\N	As 2020 draws to a close, we can reminisce about how Albertans have stepped up to make the best of our situation. We found joy in sharing our passions online with audiences that we’ve missed so dearly, and we collaborated in more creative ways than we ever thought possible. We watched as artists from across this province sang their hearts out and shared comfort with us through their music.\r\n\r\nEarlier this year, The Government of Alberta, Alberta Music, the National Music Centre (NMC), CKUA, and Stagehand collaborated on the Alberta Spotlight series, a weekly digital concert initiative that showcased over 75 acts from across the province, providing free concerts for people watching from home and support to artists during the pandemic. We’re thrilled to offer one last special holiday concert to close out this year, featuring a variety of Alberta musicians including, George Canyon, Maddie Storvold, K-Riz, Lynn Olagundoye, and Joal Kamps.\r\n\r\nTips to the venue will be distributed to that artists. 		\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	manual	\N		\N	\N	[{"mediaType":"youtube","url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/E88kDlWXGvs"}]	content

I am so grateful for Stagehand and the opportunities provided for us artists to be in the community doing what we love most. \r\n\r\nLooking forward to future opportunities going into the fall!\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nOllee 	\N	f	150.00	2	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	event

Their chance meeting soon resulted in collaborative projects, and the realization that they had actually attended the same college. After Kim left Asia for Europe, they lost contact for many years, until by chance made contact again in Calgary. Once again, an opportunity came for them to reunite, and perform together.\r\n\r\n“Home at Last” has a special meaning for both of them, from a reunited friendship, to new performance adventures here at home in Canada.\r\n\r\nSzabo & Ladick - Home at Last - this Saturday!\r\nJoin Bill Ladick and myself at Vin Room West.\r\n8561 8A Avenue SW    \r\ntel 587-353-8812\r\n\r\nSaturday November 27, 7-10pm.\r\nReservations recommended.\r\nNo cover.

13823	1612	28	7944	Ironwood Grand Re-Opening, Featuring The Blackbelts	\N	\N	2020 marks the 15th year of operation for the Ironwood Stage and Grill and the 10th year at our current location, the historic Garry Theatre in Inglewood. In that time the Ironwood has established a solid reputation for being one of the finest venues of its size hosting live music in Canada. We are a favourite stop of many national and international touring artists.\r\n\r\nIn a typical year, the Ironwood plays hosts to over 400 music performances. In 2020 the final total will certainly fall well below that number. On March 17, we reluctantly had to close our doors, complying with the provincial government’s directive to help limit the spread of the Coronavirus. \r\n\r\nThis Saturday night, June 20, The Ironwood will reopen and once again offer its audience a full, true, and unique live music experience, while remaining fully compliant with Phase 2 of the Provincial Government’s COVID-19 General Relaunch Guidance. We have  retooled our backstage, behind the renowned Casat Deck Stage to incorporate a separate glassed performing area, fully visible to the audience. Vocalists will perform from the confines of this space, safely separated from the rest of their bandmates and audience, yet fully visible and audible to all.\r\n\r\nThe musical group performing this Saturday night will be The Blackbelts, a Calgary-based Funk/Blues/Soul/Jazz trio featuring two of Calgary’s finest A-List music scene veterans, Jory Kinjo and Aaron Young, as well as veteran drummer, Steve Jackson, a recent import from Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nSeating is less than normal due to the restrictions imposed by the GOA’s coronavirus social distancing requirements. Seats must be reserved in advance (403.269.5581) and patrons are encouraged to attend in groups where possible. There will be a cover TBD. A limited menu of Ironwood favourites will be available for your dining pleasure.

I personally have played Gravity a few times now, and I would love to pack the place to hear some awesome songwriters. Cam Theissen is an incredible songwriter- he \r\njust finished his music degree out in BC and is back home. Once you hear him you will be hooked! And Matthew Korman is an amazing singer/songwriter who has also played gravity already, but is a delight to hear with catchy songs and hooks! I would be honoured if you would consider letting us take part in a songwriter night. I would love to book any thursday available in December. I listed below the needs of each musician: \r\n\r\nSidney Weich- Singer/Songwriter, vocals and guitar. (Local) \r\n\r\nCam Theissen- Singer/Songwriter, vocals and guitar. (Local) \r\n\r\nMatthew Korman- Singer/Songwriter, vocals and guitar (Matthew will bring his own amp for reverb pedal) (Local) \r\n\r\nThank you for your time\r\nSidney 	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	event

Bob Chartier came to our songwriter's meeting in Turner Valley and suggested I get connected here.  I have an album called 'Mountain Gal' which can be downloaded from iTunes, Apple Music, and Spotify.  My slogan is, "A fresh Country sound that's warm, inviting and from the heart". You can hear three of the songs from the album on my website, www.juliaroarmusic.com if you click on 'Roar Originals'.  If you click 'Songs' in the menu you can hear covers I've done with just me and my guitar.  I've improved a little in my guitar playing since the recordings but I still do have a bit more of a mellow sound without a full band backing me.  It would likely be just me singing and strumming the guitar at your venue but with notice I could possibly bring in some musical friends if you're lookin' for more of a party.  You can find additional info on my website or refer to my Stagehand profile. Thank you for your consideration. 	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	event

Sadly, I have to decline it, because I am currently travelling. I will be available in March if you would like me to re-send the invitation for March.  Also, for the time (2 hour performance) and the sound-system rental required for the performance, the amount offered is a bit small.  \r\n\r\nI really appreciate your thinking of me. And I'd love to perform at your venue in the future. \r\n\r\nShumaila 	\N	f	250.00	\N	\N	\N	\N		\N	\N	\N	event

Performing scenes inspired by original songs, the improvisers bring new meaning to the lyrics through tales of heartbreak, happiness and hope.\r\n\r\nFEATURING GUEST MUSICIAN EMILY TRIGGS\r\nEmily Triggs is a prolific songwriter with a passion for storytelling.  Sometimes likened to Patty Griffin and Michelle Shocked, Emily’s unique brand of folk/roots showcases her honest, pure vocals.\r\n\r\nEmily’s debut album ‘When Guinevere Went Under’, received radio play across the country and into the United States. Emily has performed at CBC, Vancouver Folk Music Festival, Calgary Folk Music Festival and Wide Cut Weekend. With her soon-to-be-released album, ‘Middletown, ’Triggs is busting down walls that confine an artist to expectations and genres.\r\n\r\nACT 2: DREAM TOAST\r\nA show based entirely on dream logic where dreams inspire dreams inspire dreams. It gets weird, nothing makes sense and your mom is there with a different face, but in the end it all means something. Delve into your subconscious with Dream Toast and discover the zany world of dream “logic.”\r\n\r\nTHIS TWO-ACT SHOW RUNS FROM 8PM TO 10PM WITH A BRIEF INTERMISSION.\r\nTickets are $12 online or $15 at the door.\r\n\r\nOnline sales end at 6pm day of the show.

This organization is unique in its approach to strengthen families and communities to keep children out of orphanages and trafficking and help them grow up in a loving home. They are committed to healing the root of the problem instead of offering bandaid solutions, with the ultimate goal of putting themselves out of business!  Check them out here www.thecharisproject.org \r\nYou can help!

13893	1612	28	7947	Live at the Ironwood - ROOKS - Canadian Rock & Roll	\N	\N	Been far too long since our Casat Deck Stage rocked the way it's gonna rock this Friday Night. Time to rectify the situation and put our Age of Aquarium sound booth to the max test. The Ironwood is very pleased to announce we have ROOKS playing our first live Friday night in 101 Days!\r\n\r\nSeating is limited to be compliant with COVID-19 restrictions so reserve early. Cover $15 403.269.5581 A limited menu of Ironwood favourites will be available for your dining pleasure. \r\n\r\nNow about ROOKS... \r\n\r\nROOKS is a 3 piece rock band which formed in Calgary, Alberta, Canada in July 2018. The band features Jay Bowcott on guitar and vocals, Darryl Swart on drums and Brent Rossall on bass. Their sound is unapologetic guitar rock, drawing influences from bands like Thin Lizzy, The Rolling Stones and The Black Keys.\r\n\r\nOriginally called Bowcott and the New World, the band are established members of the Canadian music scene and were introduced by ex-The Daggersguitarist, Chris Walsh, who was working with both Swart and Bowcott on separate projects. “I was looking for a drummer for a new album I was working on and Chris suggested that Darryl would be a perfect fit,” says Jay. \r\n\r\nAfter their first meeting, things developed quickly and within a few months, they had added Brent on bass and recorded a 4 song EP called Extended Play Number 1. “It started out as a solo project but I realized really quickly that everyone was contributing equally so we decided to make it a band.” \r\n\r\nAfter a whirlwind year touring western and central Canada, the band headed back into the studio in October 2019 to record their debut full-length album which coincided with their name change. “People struggled to know how to pronounce our name and we even got confused for New Order (the 80S British band) once.” laughs Swart. \r\n\r\n“From day one I was uncomfortable with my name being in the band name, so Brent suggested the name ROOKS and it immediately stuck. It has a personal meaning to us and some great imagery which inspired the sound on the new album,” adds Jay.	15	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	manual	\N	\N	\N	\N	[{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/IronwoodStage/"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/ironwoodstage/"}]	event

We will listen, learn, and build communities where racialized people and communities have equitable access to City services and programs.\r\n\r\nMeeting public safety challenges requires the entire community to come together to better understand our strengths, our challenges, and our shared commitment. We intend to facilitate conversations within and between organizations by fostering a collaborative environment. As we collect input from the community, we will use it to shape further conversations and inform additional engagement.\r\n\r\nAdjusting to life in a new country can be challenging. The Core Connections Program (C2) provides a fun space for youth who have recently arrived in Canada to integrate into the community and meet other youth. Core Connections is an ongoing program and focuses on the areas of community engagement, skill-building, and peer mentorship.\r\n		\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	manual	\N		\N	\N	\N	event

Drawing on the influences of Gillian Welch, Whiskeytown, old time, plus some Motown, she brings a little bit of twang and a whole lot of heart to the stage. She's performed in folk festivals and major cities on both sides of North America. Currently, she's artist-in-residence at University of Lethbridge's Gushul Studio, where she's recording her next album.	$15 		\N	other		\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	event

I have performed my original music at multiple venues throughout the city such as, Gravity Espresso and Wine Bar, Cowboys Casino Calgary, Ranchman’s Dancehall and many others. Following recording original songs at OCL Studios, I am very excited to release new music in the coming year for you all to hear."\r\n\r\nWe’re Jess & Robb, a girl, a guy, & acoustic guitars. “Dueting” in music and as a couple for the past two years has been wild! We celebrated the release of our self-titled debut EP in July at Café Koi. Since then, we’ve had the opportunity to perform around Calgary,  travel to Nashville for the CD Baby DIY musician conference, and play on the infamous Bluebird Café stage. Our music reflects the pop sensibilities of Taylor Swift, nonchalance of The Ramones, and the wit and heartbreak of Amy Winehouse. We can’t wait to connect and share our music and experiences with you!	$5		\N	other		\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	event

15439	\N	28	8530	SCOTT MORIN presents JAZZSEXY with Himself, JOHNNY SUMMERS, KODI HUTCHINSON, SHELDON ZANDBOER, JIM JOHNSTON & guest vocalist ANGELA WRIGLEY	\N	\N	Calgary, AB - This Sunday, September 5th will see Calgary’s most beloved live music venue continue their deep support for jazz and soulful music with the 2021 premiere of JAZZSEXY. Jazzsexy @ The Ironwood is a monthly celebration of soulful and groove-oriented jazz music, led by many of the leading musicians in the Calgary music community.\r\nNearly 10 years ago, Jazzsexy was borne out of the live-work loft of 3 Time Juno Award winning Producer, saxophone player and record label veteran Scott Morin. Back in 2012, Scott moved into a scrawling, 3000 ft. loft in the heart of Toronto’s entertainment district, near King and Bathurst. The Niagara Street loft was on the main floor of a massive warehouse building built in the 1880’s, one of the last of the illegal live-work artist warehouses in Toronto, and the former factory for the Heintzman piano company and a large coffin manufacturer in the early 1900s. In modern times, the warehouse became the home to dozens of visual artists, actors, musicians, poets and even a downstairs BDSM “dungeon”.! In addition, it was across the street from famed Director Atom Egoyan’s home, which led it to be included in some of his most famous films in various location scenes. The vibrancy of the arts community was alive on Niagara Street, and led to the inspiration resulting in a monthly jazz party at 91 Niagara Street, Scott’s home and creative space.\r\nThis monthly party soon became one of the most talked-about underground music events in Toronto, with celebrities, local news anchors, local and international musicians coming down to hang, sit in, and dig the music. The vibe of these parties was always celebratory – there was a 25 foot curved bar, a huge stage with grand piano and room for a large band, jazz awards and classic jazz photography from Paul Hoefler on the walls, and antique furniture all over the loft for folks to sit and enjoy the music from. Everyone from Grammy and Juno winners Roy Hargrove, Jeff ‘Tain’ Watts, Seamus Blake, Ron Sexsmith, JP Saxe, and dozens of others from the Toronto and NYC jazz communities came in to Jazzsexy to be part of the experience and play.\r\nThe name “Jazzsexy” came from Scott’s love of Jazz and the music of Prince. Prince recorded a legendary record in 1988 called “Lovesexy” which is where the brand for the concert series began. Prince’s spirit lives on through Jazzsexy concerts now, including arrangements of some of the geniuses’ classic songs.\r\nSince moving back home from two decades living in Toronto, NYC and Vancouver, Scott Morin has been promoting and playing jazz and soulful music around Calgary as a secondary career, but is now focusing on a number of live music initiatives in Calgary, starting off with Jazzsexy @ The Ironwood!	$25	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	manual	\N		\N	\N	\N	event

1670	186	1	727		\N	\N	Little Ole Wine Drinker (the artist formerly known as Mark Cassano) is a guitarist/singer/songwriter based in Calgary. Think of him as the metaphorical musical love child of Nat King Cole and Dolly Parton.....  hmm... how about Willie Nelson and Norah Jones? Maybe Julie London and Lyle Lovett? Okay... that is not getting any less creepy, but you get the idea. His original songs are a blend of folk and jazz with a touch of blues and country. His set list consists of songs that he loves listening to and learning - and, here's the challenge, songs that he can do some semblance of justice to. They range from classic jazz standards to old time country to Americana. And he will make sure to play his wide variety of homemade mid-life crisis ballads and anthems. Recording will begin on his first solo album - he promises... soon...... he swears..... yep.....	$5		\N	other		\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	event

A low-key event that I host the 4th Thursday of each month (there are other hosts on the other Thursdays of each month).  Typically we get a relatively small audience, so the donations are usually modest, but it's always fun and I've never had a performer who regretted coming out.  I've got an FAQ that I can send if you're interested.  We can accommodate a keyboard, though a guitar is easier to manage.  If you're interested but unavailable for October, I will have future opportunities on the 4th Thursday of most months.

Their chance meeting soon resulted in collaborative projects, and the realization that they had actually attended the same college. After Kim left Asia for Europe and Bill moved on to Singapore, they lost contact for many years, until by chance made contact again in Calgary. Once again, an opportunity came for them to reunite, and perform together.\r\n\r\n“Home at Last” has a special meaning for both of them, from a reunited friendship, to new performance adventures here at home in Canada.\r\n\r\nSzabo and Ladick at Vin Room West\r\nReservations Recommended\r\n(587) 353-8812\r\n8561 8A Ave SW\r\n\r\nPlease support live music wherever you can.\r\nSee you there!\r\n	No Cover - but reservations recommended!	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	manual	\N		Vin Room West	\N	\N	\N

Once again, an opportunity came for them to reunite, and perform together.\r\n\r\n“Home at Last” has a special meaning for both of them, from a reunited friendship, to new performance adventures here at home in Canada.\r\n\r\nReservations recommended. \r\n(587) 353-8812\r\n8561 8A Ave SW, Calgary\r\n\r\nPlease support live music wherever you can.\r\nSee you there!\r\n	No Cover - but reservations recommended!	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	manual	\N		Vin Room West	\N	\N	\N

Their chance meeting soon resulted in collaborative projects, and the realization that they had actually attended the same college. After Kim left Asia for Europe, they lost contact for many years, until by chance made contact again in Calgary. Once again, an opportunity came for them to reunite, and perform together.\r\n\r\n“Home at Last” has a special meaning for both of them, from a reunited friendship, to new performance adventures here at home in Canada.\r\n\r\nSzabo & Ladick - Home at Last - this Saturday. \r\nJoin Bill Ladick and myself szabo at Koi \r\nTHIS Saturday Sept 18, 7-10PM.\r\n\r\nReservations recommended. \r\nCall 403-206-1564.\r\n1011 1 St SW\r\n\r\nCover: "Pay what you Wish". \r\nPlease support live music wherever you can.\r\nSee you there!

16373	1355	1	9170	Meadow Drive and Great Grey	\N	\N	Headed up by childhood friends Jenna and Charity, Meadow Drive hails from Calgary, Alberta. Due to their vast range of musical influences, the band's distinct sound is a direct result of the unique playing style of each member, rather than their alignment with any particular genre. The band's jazz roots are apparent in the harmonic structure of the songs and melodic importance of the bass, while their love of funk and disco often shines through with crisp, clean guitar riffs and syncopated grooves. Smooth, yet powerful vocals bring even their rock influenced repertoire under the umbrella of the sound they call their own.\r\nCalvin has always been writing music, even as a young kid.  He found his home in hardcore/metal bands as a youth, but he always had his own acoustic songs going on in the background.  Although he lived in Australia at the time, he was inspired by the bleak and dreary winter landscapes of his Canadian home, and slowly put an album together.  Upon moving home, he enlisted a best friend, his sister and his wife, and The Great Grey was born.	$15	$25 tab\r\nSoundboard and speakers.  Brining own equipment to.

2056	752	1	1022	Mason Jenkins with opener Cyd Hall.	\N	\N	For Cyd Hall, words have always been a comfort. Whether it’s listening to someone’s story or spilling her own thoughts, the act is therapeutic. She uses music to convey that energy and pushes the love back into the universe. She’s just stepping into the incredible YYC art scene and will enjoy the adventure, wherever it may lead.\r\n\r\nMason's songs are velvet paintings. They are elegantly grafted and from a forgotten era and delightfully campy. His songwriting is built upon on a darkness that makes the listener ask out loud "...hey, is this guy ok?" He most definitely is, but it's best to come find out for yourself.	$5	2 mics	\N	other		\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	event

While scavenging through a garage sale, Kate found a used ukulele - a tool that shaped her music journey over the past 6 years. Her blended genre sound is an eclectic mix of emotive folk and soulful jazzy pop, with major influences from timeless voices such as Etta James, Ella Fitzgerald, and Joni Mitchell. Stevens likes to describe her sound as "if Amy Winehouse and Carole King had a lovechild"\r\nHer unique soulful melodies are advanced yet approachable and truly heartfelt. Kate’s latest singles, "Right Choice" and  "it's real" follow her debut EP Handmade Rumours from June 2017. Kate is a powerful and engaging performer that captivates audiences of all ages. Kate is also the recipient of the 2018 Zachariah and the Prophets Memorial Award.	$5		\N	other		\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	event

A generous demeanor, a delicate wit, and an empathetic understanding of audiences of all shapes, his performances are as true and honest as the songs themselves. His sophomore album, Civil War will be launched March 2019. You can already check out some of his newest work here: \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThOBkhS2aVM \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8YeBlJkXio \r\n\r\nS.K. Wellington (formerly The Wellington Folk):\r\nFitting in the perfect pocket of folk, indie, pop, and rock - S.K. Wellington's debut EP "Where the Earth Meets the Sea" was released September 2018. S.K. is most often found performing with a 5 piece band, but will be found pared down for this session at Gravity. With vocals that are equal parts tender and powerful, catchy melody lines and pulsing rhythmic guitar, Wellington provides a raw and authentic performance.\r\nYou can check out the EP here:\r\nhttps://skwellington.bandcamp.com/releases \r\n	$10		\N	other		\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	event

The event is really fun, super chill, and a great opportunity to share and hear some beautiful music. We each get a $25 bar tab so you can get a bite and a drink and we set up a box for donations. You would need 6 songs prepared for the evening. We take a short 15-20 minute break half-way through. Let me know!	By Donations 		\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	event

Strongly suggest you make a reservation for this one!\r\n\r\nRaised in a small prairie town, Christina grew up in a musical family where the sounds of southern rock, country, gospel and blues could often be heard on playing on her Dad’s stereo.  Her first live performance was at 5 years old, and she learned to play guitar at age 12.  In her teens, she became enamoured with artists like Etta James, Mavis Staples, Nina Simone, The Band, JJ Cale, and Bob Dylan.  In 2014, Christina went back to writing, recording and performing after taking a hiatus to raise her three daughters, one of whom has a cognitive disability.

Danah-Lee’s last album, The Post Concussion Syndrome (December 1, 2017), has turned her very real-life experiences into songs. The album is a response to life unfolding – sometimes tragic and at other times euphoric.\r\n\r\nNOW - in 2019, the Ottawa Valley, Ontario-based singer songwriter has completed her latest EP, Sunshine & Bonbons (March 1, 2019). Danah worked with award winning producer Jordon Zadorozny (Courtney Love, Sam Roberts), and Phil Hulan (Belvue, Almost Kennedy), to record an album that is quite different than anything Danah has released before. Sunshine & Bonbons is one-part edgy, and one-part tug at your heart strings!	Tips accepted	2 miss	\N	other		\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	event

After going solo for a little while he decided to add members and create a full band sound. Adding Mackenzie’s vocals has brought depth and expanded harmonizing possibilities as well as it has deepened the stories told in the music. Chris’ bass allows for the music to be felt as well as heard, and Manuel’s drumming holds us all together and grabs the attention of listeners with unique fills. \r\n\r\nR&B singer-songwriter Zacarias plays with power trio and writes about intimate love, ethnic roots, and finding truth.	$8	$25 tab for each band.\r\n2 mics	\N	other		\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	event

If you could plan to arrive by 5:15ish to set up although note that you won't be able to soundcheck until after the pitches have finished.

I am looking for a people for May 30th as one of my artists had to cancel due to a family matter. The event is really fun, super chill, and a great opportunity to share and hear some beautiful music. We each get a $25 bar tab so you can get a bite and a drink and we set up a box for donations. You would need 6 songs prepared for the evening. We take a short 15-20 minute break half-way through. Let me know! 	By Donation 		\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	event

Because I play as a solo act, it's easy to set up and take down, and works perfectly in a festival atmosphere! I've played all around Calgary and Alberta, at venues like Brewsters, Vagabond, Half-Hitch Brewery, and have festival experience, (Rock Creek Music Festival, Bragg Creek Days). I have about 80 minutes of original music and up to six hours of cover songs! I'd love to work with your event and play as part of it, please don't hesitate to contact me with any questions! I have links to music, media, and more on my website as well. \r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n- Grant Kanigan	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	event

4701	1073	42	\N		\N	\N	Hi Cam! \r\nI am one of the hosts at Gravity for the sing-songwriter evenings. I am looking for a people for May 30th as one of my artists had to cancel due to a family matter. The event is really fun, super chill, and a great opportunity to share and hear some beautiful music. We each get a $25 bar tab so you can get a bite and a drink and we set up a box for donations. You would need 6 songs prepared for the evening. We take a short 15-20 minute break half-way through. Let me know. 	By Donation 		artist	other	Unfortunatlely I have to decline. I’ll be moving to Toronto on Wednesday. Sad that this doesn’t line up as I was really hoping to play your guys’ venue before I left.\r\nCam	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	event

I could perhaps look to shift my schedule around but I'd have to look into that. \r\n\r\nIs there another time slot that is available? Perhaps on the Thursday (5th) or earlier evening on the (7th)?\r\n\r\nIf that is the only option available, please let me know and I will look to see what I can make work. 	The instrumentation and size of the band for a Matt Blais performance is deliberately customizable so as to provide a unique show that perfectly tailored show that fits the venue and opportunity. Matt Blais ranges from a solo acoustic act to a 7 piece band depending on factors such as stage size, budget, etc. Please reach out to discuss further. 	t	200.00	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	event

However after a bit of singing this afternoon my voice is in pretty rough shape and if I perform tomorrow it will likely only get worse. I don't want to injure my voice/prolong being sick, and so it is probably best if I stay home. My apologies for the inconvenience.	\N	f	100.00	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	event

I use an acoustic Martin guitar, (with a pickup), a loop pedal, and vocals to create a unique, eclectic and enjoyable musical experience. Hailing from Calgary, Alberta, I've played bars, local events, private parties, corporate events, and festivals, including Waynestock, Beakerhead, and Bragg Creek days, among others. I would love to be a part of this years Lilac festival! I have over 90 minutes of original folk-rock songs and hundreds of covers in my catalogue! My Stagehand profile includes media and photos as well as a link to my website - which features video, pictures, information and more, as well as links to listen to my full-length album on streaming services like Spotify, iTunes and YouTube. I hope to hear from you soon! The only requirements I need are an electrical outlet for my loop system - otherwise, I'm good to just plug and play! 	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	event

With TAYLR playing, your odds improve, just remember you need to ask first!\r\n\r\nMason Jenkins is an advocate and spokesperson for bringing back the "Calgary Wave" and tries embody the attitude of a very good dog. Jenkins is a transgender man, sharing stories of his adventures in gender and navigating the world as a retired lesbian. His songs are velvet paintings, delightfully campy, and welcomed in any grandmother's living room. Velvet paintings are built on darkness, just like Jenkins’ humour and insights. Contrast is what makes the highlights brighter, any dog could tell you that.	$10	2 mics and 1 DI	\N	other		\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	event

We are looking forward to reconnecting in the near future about our relaunch kick-off activities.\r\n\r\nPlease note, that all events and programming have been canceled upto July 1, 2020. We will not be accepting any booking requests at this time.  Please visit www.downtowncalgary.com for updates regarding our relaunch and recovery campaign.

5282	1105	39	3147		\N	\N			Hi Eileen, it is Derek helping out the Startup Grind folks.  Here is the event I mentioned to you.  They would love to have you.  Let me know if you have any questions.  You would probably need to be amplified for this one as it can get loud in there.  All the PA is supplied though.  As discussed you would be free to leave between 6:30 & 8pm, or you are welcome to stay for the program if you are interested.  I will send you a copy of the invite.  Thanks ! 	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	event
