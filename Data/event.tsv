Time to rectify the situation and put our Age of Aquarium sound booth to the max test. The Ironwood is very pleased to announce we have ROOKS playing our first live Friday night in 101 Days!\r\n\r\nSeating is limited to be compliant with COVID-19 restrictions so reserve early. Cover $15 403.269.5581 A limited menu of Ironwood favourites will be available for your dining pleasure. \r\n\r\nNow about ROOKS... \r\n\r\nROOKS is a 3 piece rock band which formed in Calgary, Alberta, Canada in July 2018. The band features Jay Bowcott on guitar and vocals, Darryl Swart on drums and Brent Rossall on bass. Their sound is unapologetic guitar rock, drawing influences from bands like Thin Lizzy, The Rolling Stones and The Black Keys.\r\n\r\nOriginally called Bowcott and the New World, the band are established members of the Canadian music scene and were introduced by ex-The Daggersguitarist, Chris Walsh, who was working with both Swart and Bowcott on separate projects. “I was looking for a drummer for a new album I was working on and Chris suggested that Darryl would be a perfect fit,” says Jay. \r\n\r\nAfter their first meeting, things developed quickly and within a few months, they had added Brent on bass and recorded a 4 song EP called Extended Play Number 1. “It started out as a solo project but I realized really quickly that everyone was contributing equally so we decided to make it a band.” \r\n\r\nAfter a whirlwind year touring western and central Canada, the band headed back into the studio in October 2019 to record their debut full-length album which coincided with their name change. “People struggled to know how to pronounce our name and we even got confused for New Order (the 80S British band) once.” laughs Swart. \r\n\r\n“From day one I was uncomfortable with my name being in the band name, so Brent suggested the name ROOKS and it immediately stuck. It has a personal meaning to us and some great imagery which inspired the sound on the new album,” adds Jay.	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	[{"mediaType":"facebook","url":"https://www.facebook.com/IronwoodStage/"},{"mediaType":"instagram","url":"https://www.instagram.com/ironwoodstage/"}]

Tom Phillips takes the Casat Deck at the Ironwood for the 13th year in a row on Parade Day, joined this year by Kit Johnson and Tim Leacock. Due to limited seating and social distancing requirements, reservations are required. 20$ cover charge. Call 403-269-5581 for reservations. Shine up your boots and come on down!!!\r\n\r\nNow more about Tom...\r\n\r\nTOM PHILLIPS Calgary, Alberta Band leader. Honky-tonk hero. Even soundtrack writer for a book (a Canadian first, for a Will Ferguson novel.) Survivor and singer of cautionary tales. You want it, you got it from Tom Phillips, whose career’s turned itself inside out so often that at times he appears to be a shape shifter. During the past few years, Phillips’ transformation was also physical as he swapped alcohol for coffee and his trademark cowboy boots and shirts for polished shoes and tailored suits. But appearances distract, and Phillips is no shape shifter: if you took a musical x-ray during every incarnation, you’d find song writing as the bedrock under the suits, boots, cowboy hats and skin. Which explains why revered blues artist Eric Bibb covered Phillips’ touchstone tune, Ribbons and Bows, on one of his albums. An esteemed statesperson of the Calgary music scene, Phillips earned his laurels over decades. He recorded with Gordon Lightfoot’s band in Toronto before releasing several albums, both live and in studio, with his legendary long time honky-tonk band The Men of Constant Sorrow (MOCS). He also released an acoustic solo album, paid homage to Hank Williams on the Sorrow Bound project, and smashed his comfort zone with a daring, darling album of cover songs from punk and rock territory. He’s often found anchoring musical gatherings that celebrate the songs of Haggard, Dylan, Springsteen and Lightfoot. \r\n\r\nThe evolution continues on his most recent work with the D.T.’s (Difficult Transitions). The band formed serendipitously at bars and open stages, learning Phillips’ most recent songs onstage just in time for his last record. With MOCS veteran Tim Leacock (The Co-Dependents), Ian Grant (Art Bergmann, Cat Ranch), Geoff Brock and sisters Shaye and Sydney Zadravec, the D.T.’s translate Phillips’ songs into live performances that deliver musical delights which offer style without flash. So take a musical walk with Phillips and gaze at life through his seasoned eyes. He’s got it covered with a hundred songs that undress truths so simple they’re frightening. \r\n\r\nEver cheated on a lover, driven home drunk, been bucked off your horse, or been the last person in the bar when the lights came up? If you’ve been stranded on the highway, woken up in the wrong bed, walked home barefoot in a ball gown in the morning rain, or wished you could have a re-do on any of these choices, Phillips has a song for you. -  MLW   https://www.tomphillipsmusic.com/	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N

Jenkins is a transgender man, sharing stories of his adventures in gender and navigating the world as a retired lesbian.

Mark Cassano aka Little Ole Wine Drinker, performs both solo and in bands, playing originals and carefully chosen jazz, folk, and country standards. Mark will be joined by Elle, she basically came out of the womb singing. A pure pleasure seeker for classical, electronic, folk and country. She loves to croon old country like Dolly, Willie, Cline, Cash and Wilf Carter. Elle works as a Music Therapist in Calgary and loves to sing songs that she doesn't have to sing for work. Songwriting is a form of catharsis for Elle. What you see is what you get, no phoney business here.	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N

Featuring the sultry voice of Robin Huber, ‘Round Midnight has been wowing audiences with their unique approach to jazz, blues and R&B, from the timeless standards of the 1920’s through to jazz interpretations of contemporary hits.  Whether it’s a slow ballad or an up-tempo bounce tune, Robin’s magical voice blends perfectly with the traditional acoustic jazz combo sound of Shawn Ferguson (tenor sax), Jay Harman (guitar) and Bill Durtler (upright bass). This evening is sure to get your toes tapping and your lips smiling.

We’re all a bunch of goofy eggheads who would love to talk music with you, share a memory, or jam out in a sweaty basement or street corner.  \n\nCurrently, we are working closely with Juno Award nominee, Nils Mikkelsen (AM Static), to create a six song EP that will showcase the bands groovy and soulful new sound. The Ep, We’re Here For Each Other, is set to be released in late 2017.	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N

135	121	1	\N	cancelled	\N	$5	Ten albums into an already acclaimed career, Stephen Simmons sharpens his rootsy folk-rock with A World Without, a record that mixes the twang of country music — a genre that provided the soundtrack for his childhood in small-town Tennessee — with the sharp observations of a singer/songwriter and the stomp of rural, roadhouse rock & roll.\n \nA road warrior with an audience on both sides of the Atlantic, Simmons has spent most of his adulthood on stage, playing songs in ten different countries along the way. Recorded with members of his touring band, A World Without explores a life lived on the run, taking a look at the intersection between art, commerce, love, and travel. The songs are equal parts biography and fiction, with Simmons shining a light on those who travel and create for a living.	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N

8530	\N	28	\N	public	SCOTT MORIN presents JAZZSEXY with Himself, JOHNNY SUMMERS, KODI HUTCHINSON, SHELDON ZANDBOER, JIM JOHNSTON & guest vocalist ANGELA WRIGLEY	$25	Calgary, AB - This Sunday, September 5th will see Calgary’s most beloved live music venue continue their deep support for jazz and soulful music with the 2021 premiere of JAZZSEXY. Jazzsexy @ The Ironwood is a monthly celebration of soulful and groove-oriented jazz music, led by many of the leading musicians in the Calgary music community.\r\nNearly 10 years ago, Jazzsexy was borne out of the live-work loft of 3 Time Juno Award winning Producer, saxophone player and record label veteran Scott Morin. Back in 2012, Scott moved into a scrawling, 3000 ft. loft in the heart of Toronto’s entertainment district, near King and Bathurst. The Niagara Street loft was on the main floor of a massive warehouse building built in the 1880’s, one of the last of the illegal live-work artist warehouses in Toronto, and the former factory for the Heintzman piano company and a large coffin manufacturer in the early 1900s. In modern times, the warehouse became the home to dozens of visual artists, actors, musicians, poets and even a downstairs BDSM “dungeon”.! In addition, it was across the street from famed Director Atom Egoyan’s home, which led it to be included in some of his most famous films in various location scenes. The vibrancy of the arts community was alive on Niagara Street, and led to the inspiration resulting in a monthly jazz party at 91 Niagara Street, Scott’s home and creative space.\r\nThis monthly party soon became one of the most talked-about underground music events in Toronto, with celebrities, local news anchors, local and international musicians coming down to hang, sit in, and dig the music. The vibe of these parties was always celebratory – there was a 25 foot curved bar, a huge stage with grand piano and room for a large band, jazz awards and classic jazz photography from Paul Hoefler on the walls, and antique furniture all over the loft for folks to sit and enjoy the music from. Everyone from Grammy and Juno winners Roy Hargrove, Jeff ‘Tain’ Watts, Seamus Blake, Ron Sexsmith, JP Saxe, and dozens of others from the Toronto and NYC jazz communities came in to Jazzsexy to be part of the experience and play.\r\nThe name “Jazzsexy” came from Scott’s love of Jazz and the music of Prince. Prince recorded a legendary record in 1988 called “Lovesexy” which is where the brand for the concert series began. Prince’s spirit lives on through Jazzsexy concerts now, including arrangements of some of the geniuses’ classic songs.\r\nSince moving back home from two decades living in Toronto, NYC and Vancouver, Scott Morin has been promoting and playing jazz and soulful music around Calgary as a secondary career, but is now focusing on a number of live music initiatives in Calgary, starting off with Jazzsexy @ The Ironwood!	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N

Chat with a friend, dance uncontrollably, have an Old Fashioned (neat), or lay quietly, motionless, focusing on each and every syllable and note. We bring in a variety of our past and present experiences, music tastes, and personalities. We’re a blend of classically trained instrumentalists, leaning on our jazz, soul, & folk inspirations like Typhoon, Dan Mangan, Hiatus Kaiyote & Christian Scott. Alongside Juno Award nominee, Nils Mikkelsen (AM Static), we have created a six song EP that will showcase the bands groovy and soulful new sound. The EP, We’re Here For Each Other, is set to be released in early 2018.	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N

From obscure song covers, nostalgic heart-warming melodies and a variety of roots rock in between, he has a wide repertoire to draw upon. Rev Frank has performed in various venues and built a reputation as a soulful “from the heart” singer. The flexibility of Rev Frank’s style including country, roots, rock and blues has allowed him to perform alongside a who’s who of great Alberta artists. Currently Rev Frank is writing original material and brushing the dust off his electric guitar creating even more variety and dynamics.  The Reverend is not actually a man of the cloth! Others named him after officiating the wedding of his great friend Tom Phillips and the title ‘Reverend’ just seemed oddly appropriate in the way that opposites often do!	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N

Make no mistake, he knows how to work too -no one teaches themselves to play the fiddle that well without work- but it’s what he does with the spoils of the effort that sets him apart: he plays. With every leap and holler the word conjures, he throws himself into his instruments and leaves nothing out.

I have performed my original music at multiple venues throughout the city such as, Gravity Espresso and Wine Bar, Cowboys Casino Calgary, Ranchman’s Dancehall and many others. Following recording original songs at OCL Studios, I am very excited to release new music in the coming year for you all to hear."\r\n\r\nWe’re Jess & Robb, a girl, a guy, & acoustic guitars. “Dueting” in music and as a couple for the past two years has been wild! We celebrated the release of our self-titled debut EP in July at Café Koi. Since then, we’ve had the opportunity to perform around Calgary,  travel to Nashville for the CD Baby DIY musician conference, and play on the infamous Bluebird Café stage. Our music reflects the pop sensibilities of Taylor Swift, nonchalance of The Ramones, and the wit and heartbreak of Amy Winehouse. We can’t wait to connect and share our music and experiences with you!	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N

439	68	1	\N	public	Book Release: Clem Martni’s new novel, The Comedian	No Charge	In the Roman Republic, comedy is a serious business. Nobody knows this better than Titus Maccius Plautus, the principal comic playwright of his time. Licking his wounds after a series of artistic flops and financial disasters, Plautus returns from his refuge in the country to Rome, desperate to produce a new play. \n\nWith limited financial backing provided by tough and striking bar owner Casina, Plautus recruits a company of actors from the amateurs and cast-offs he can afford. Led by a disreputable drunk who just happens to have a pedigree with one of the most respected traveling Greek acting guilds, the motley company unites an eccentric cast of characters on and off the stage. From Orestes, Plautus’ dour, thrifty director to the eager but untrained neophyte, Fronto, to the debt-plagued Plautus himself, each has a role to play, and each is not quite what they seem.\n\nCan this company of misfits come together in time – and remain together long enough – to find success on the stage? With his creditors closing in, can Plautus stay one step ahead, or will he be finished, once and for all? Redolent with the sights and scents of the ancient world, this novel is a rowdy, boisterous ride through the realm of theater in its infancy.	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N

Think of him as the metaphorical musical love child of Nat King Cole and Dolly Parton.....  hmm... how about Willie Nelson and Norah Jones? Maybe Julie London and Lyle Lovett? Okay... that is not getting any less creepy, but you get the idea. His original songs are a blend of folk and jazz with a touch of blues and country. His set list consists of songs that he loves listening to and learning - and, here's the challenge, songs that he can do some semblance of justice to. They range from classic jazz standards to old time country to Americana. And he will make sure to play his wide variety of homemade mid-life crisis ballads and anthems. Recording will begin on his first solo album - he promises... soon...... he swears..... yep.....	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N

While scavenging through a garage sale, Kate found a used ukulele - a tool that shaped her music journey over the past 6 years. Her blended genre sound is an eclectic mix of emotive folk and soulful jazzy pop, with major influences from timeless voices such as Etta James, Ella Fitzgerald, and Joni Mitchell. Stevens likes to describe her sound as "if Amy Winehouse and Carole King had a lovechild"\r\nHer unique soulful melodies are advanced yet approachable and truly heartfelt. Kate’s latest singles, "Right Choice" and  "it's real" follow her debut EP Handmade Rumours from June 2017. Kate is a powerful and engaging performer that captivates audiences of all ages. Kate is also the recipient of the 2018 Zachariah and the Prophets Memorial Award.	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N
1022	752	1	\N	public	Mason Jenkins with opener Cyd Hall.	$5	For Cyd Hall, words have always been a comfort. Whether it’s listening to someone’s story or spilling her own thoughts, the act is therapeutic. She uses music to convey that energy and pushes the love back into the universe. She’s just stepping into the incredible YYC art scene and will enjoy the adventure, wherever it may lead.\r\n\r\nMason's songs are velvet paintings. They are elegantly grafted and from a forgotten era and delightfully campy. His songwriting is built upon on a darkness that makes the listener ask out loud "...hey, is this guy ok?" He most definitely is, but it's best to come find out for yourself.	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N

Influenced by writers like Jon Foreman and Gregory Alan Isakov; Kyle is marked with a passion for telling the truth and finding the beauty woven into every person's story. His laid back personality translates smoothly to the "easy listening" nature of his music, and his storytelling at live shows is usually equally as light and humorous as it is deep and thought-provoking. One of his latest singles was recently featured in Apple Music's "Best of the Week" playlist, and he is on tour this year showcasing his latest work, a 10 song album entitled, "Slow Down".	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N

After going solo for a little while he decided to add members and create a full band sound. Adding Mackenzie’s vocals has brought depth and expanded harmonizing possibilities as well as it has deepened the stories told in the music. Chris’ bass allows for the music to be felt as well as heard, and Manuel’s drumming holds us all together and grabs the attention of listeners with unique fills. \r\n\r\nR&B singer-songwriter Zacarias plays with power trio and writes about intimate love, ethnic roots, and finding truth.	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N

A pure pleasure seeker for classical, electronic, folk and country. She loves to croon old country like Dolly, Willie, Cline, Cash and Wilf Carter. Elle works as a Music Therapist in Calgary and loves to sing songs that she doesn't have to sing for work. Songwriting is a form of catharsis for Elle. What you see is what you get, no phoney business here.	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N

James Reckseidler, solo artist and frontman of Calgary's rock recording act reijo, brings raw energy and emotion to all he does. Experience James intimate and connect, finding uplifting power in his sweeping melodies and reflective, poetic lyrics.\r\n\r\nNicola’s music centres around her chameleonic vocals - at one moment with a hint of tobacco in her voice, the next outright rocking - strummed and finger picked guitar, and versatile, melodic songwriting. Nicola’s songs are often built around open and\r\n alternate guitar tunings that allow her to throw her music theory upbringing out the window.	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N

Szabo & Ladick - jazz, pop & crossovers: a lifetime of performing and the experience has curated a repertoire that spans genres. \r\n\r\nKim Szabo and Bill Ladick, both originally from Canada, met in Osaka, Japan, while performing in different venues. Their chance meeting soon resulted in collaborative projects, and the realization that they had actually attended the same college. After Kim left Asia for Europe and Bill moved on to Singapore, they lost contact for many years, until by chance made contact again in Calgary. Once again, an opportunity came for them to reunite, and perform together.\r\n\r\n“Home at Last” has a special meaning for both of them, from a reunited friendship, to new performance adventures here at home in Canada.\r\n\r\nSzabo and Ladick at Vin Room West\r\nReservations Recommended\r\n(587) 353-8812\r\n8561 8A Ave SW\r\n\r\nPlease support live music wherever you can.\r\nSee you there!\r\n	\N	\N	t	Vin Room West	\N	\N

9170	1355	1	\N	public	Meadow Drive and Great Grey	$15	Headed up by childhood friends Jenna and Charity, Meadow Drive hails from Calgary, Alberta. Due to their vast range of musical influences, the band's distinct sound is a direct result of the unique playing style of each member, rather than their alignment with any particular genre. The band's jazz roots are apparent in the harmonic structure of the songs and melodic importance of the bass, while their love of funk and disco often shines through with crisp, clean guitar riffs and syncopated grooves. Smooth, yet powerful vocals bring even their rock influenced repertoire under the umbrella of the sound they call their own.\r\nCalvin has always been writing music, even as a young kid.  He found his home in hardcore/metal bands as a youth, but he always had his own acoustic songs going on in the background.  Although he lived in Australia at the time, he was inspired by the bleak and dreary winter landscapes of his Canadian home, and slowly put an album together.  Upon moving home, he enlisted a best friend, his sister and his wife, and The Great Grey was born.	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N

They started making some funky tunes together and then found their missing piece Connor. They were once told they sound like Alabama Shakes meets the Red Hot Chilli Peppers meets Metallica so that's pretty tight.\r\n\r\nLittle Super Dangerous’ music moves between genres held-together by sing-along choruses, infectious grooves, and gorgeous vocal harmonies. Formed in Early 2022 the band has racked up an impressive resume having their debut single featured on CJSW and opening for Jann Arden, Rueben & The Dark and Scenic Route to Alaska.\r\n\r\nLittleSuperDangerous.com	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N

The event will take place at Festival Hall located in Inglewood and will feature incredible artists such as Remix: Powered by Revv52, Two Late to the Party, Laura Schoenberg Music and more!\r\n\r\nOne of the funds that 'A Little Night Music' will be supporting is Aspen's Flexible Wellness Fund. This fund was developed to cover costs for items and experiences that aren't always affordable for families living in poverty but are undeniably meaningful to the people that Aspen works with. To date this fund has provided many wellness opportunities including a McDonalds birthday party for a six year old boy, outfitting a youth for her first summer camp adventure and allowing for a grieving mother to receive a much needed massage.\r\n\r\nMore details go to https://www.aspenfamily.org/nightmusic	\N	\N	t	Festival Hall	\N	\N
